Aim for a desirable Speed breakpoint next (134 minimum recommended). After achieving these goals stack more Break Effect to improve Ruan's burst damage or invest in more Speed or DEF% and HP% to make her more durable.SPEED: Ruan Mei, is a skill point positive support so stacking more Speed on her will assist with skill point generation. Unlike other supports though she can offer the full benefits of her kit without worrying about how fast she is compared to the rest of her team. Because of this until you achieve her Break requirements Speed is a lower priority.BREAK EFFECT: Thanks to Ruan's bonus ability - Candle Lights on Still Waters - she gains up to 36% increased damage for the whole team when at 180% Break Effect or higher. Ensuring this is the case is your number 1 priority when building Ruan. More Break Effect than this is still helpful, it will boost Ruan's damage contribution in fights offering even higher burst damage allowing for incredibly easy removal of smaller enemies thanks to her talent.Energy Recharge: To consistently achieve a 4-action rotation when using her Signature, Ruan requires an Energy Recharge rope, When using S5 Meshing Cogs or S5 Memories of the Past to consistently gain a 3-action rotation it's also required,Due to the power of her Ultimate, gaining Energy Recharge where it makes sense for your build and team comps is advised."

Most endgame fights feature high-frequency single target and AoE hits to remedy this issue though so they only required for min-maxing consistency.Talia: Kingdom of BanditryIf you're struggling with reaching the Break Effect cap, the set will help you, but keep in mind that it's not stamina-efficient to farm it."

        "formatted": "Ruan Mei is an exceptional support character. She is able to effortlessly buff the whole team\u2019s DMG and increase everyone\u2019s Break Efficiency with her Skill, something no other character is currently able to do. Her Ultimate increases all allies\u2019 RES PEN and is able to delay the enemies again once their Weakness Break ends. She\u2019s even got free bonus Break damage from her Talent that activates whenever allies Break an enemy, and the Talent itself provides a small but permanent SPD boost to all other characters in the party.The definitely sane, definitely not megalomaniacal Genius Society member, Ruan Mei, is a fairly ridiculous character in the game. She is our very first support character to increase the Weakness Break Efficiency of characters; you know that one Nihility blessing in the Simulated Universe? Night Beyond Pyre, the one that increases Break Efficiency by 30%? Yeah, well, Ruan Mei can increase that by 50% and also have it permanently active.Ruan Mei\u2019s Skill gives her a buff called Overtone, lasting for 3 turns. This ticks down at the start of her turn. While she has Overtone, all allies\u2019 DMG increases by 32% and Weakness Break Efficiency increases by 50%. This is kind of absurd already given that the application of this buff is entirely effortless, and having it last for 3 turns means that Ruan Mei has plenty of time to recover the SP she spent setting it up and then some. Weakness Break Efficiency is exceedingly powerful. Enemies take slightly reduced damage from all sources while they are not Broken, and this gets removed once they do get Broken, so if you\u2019ve ever wondered why a Broken enemy seems to be taking so much more damage, this is why.\u00a0Usually, there is not a large window of opportunity to take advantage of this state, and it may be preferable to hold off on using big hitting abilities until after the enemy has recovered from Break so as to resume dealing Toughness damage. With this Skill\u2019s effects active, you not only get enemies into that state faster, but it\u2019s easier to repeatedly get them to that state even with weaker hitting attacks, meaning you\u2019re more able to land those huge hits during the enemies\u2019 most vulnerable period.Ruan Mei\u2019s Ultimate deploys a field for 2 turns, and this also ticks down at the start of her turn. While the field is active, all allies get 25% All-Type RES PEN. If you\u2019ve been around for a while, or if you\u2019re an avid user of Seele, you should understand how rare and powerful Resistance Penetration is by now. 25% is ridiculous, and with a 2-turn duration based on Ruan Mei\u2019s turns, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to abuse this to the player\u2019s benefit with faster characters or with turn manipulation.In addition to this, ally attacks within the field apply a debuff to enemies called Thanatoplum Rebloom to enemies they hit. This effect triggers when an enemy attempts to recover from Weakness Break, extending their Weakness Break and delaying their action by 20% of Ruan Mei\u2019s Break Effect plus 10%. This re-Break will also deal 50% of Ruan Mei\u2019s Ice Break DMG. This works in tandem with her Skill to just bully enemies; you Break them faster with the Break Efficiency and then get to keep them Broken for longer, all while benefiting from the DMG bonuses and RES PEN. Important to note that Thanatoplum Rebloom can only trigger again after the enemy has fully recovered from Weakness Break.\u00a0The buffs she provides are already highly impressive even without considering the bonus provided by the Break extension, but with her Talent she provides even more benefits, and she can even contribute some damage of her own. She permanently increases all other teammates\u2019 SPD by 10%, and whenever an ally Breaks an enemy, Ruan Mei will instantly deal damage equal to 120% of her Ice Break DMG. This is not a follow-up attack, this damage is inflicted alongside the Break damage of the ally inflicting Break.A 10% SPD boost is just about enough to be significant and to meet specific SPD thresholds for characters. However, being able to contribute Break damage without even needing to be the one to Break enemies is ridiculously good, especially as it\u2019s actually a higher multiplier if you let other allies do it for you; this solves the biggest problem with building for Break Effect which is that if you\u2019re not the one to Break enemies, that stat is functionally useless for you. For Ruan Mei, this is most assuredly not the case, so don\u2019t be surprised to be seeing light blue damage numbers in the five-digit range showing up alongside Breaks later on.It\u2019s clear by now that Ruan Mei benefits the Break playstyle significantly and also benefits from Break Effect% herself as she has so many ways to utilise it. With her Bonus Ability Traces, Ruan Mei reaches a new height that makes her supportive capabilities begin to approach the omnipresent power of Bronya. A2 increases all allies\u2019 Break Effect by 20%, and A4 will regenerate 5 Energy for Ruan Mei at the start of her turn.A6 is where the big money is; in combat, for every 10% Break Effect that Ruan Mei has that exceeds 120%, her Skill\u2019s DMG bonus increases by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 36% extra. That means that if you can reach at least 180% Break Effect, Ruan Mei\u2019s Skill is now providing a ridiculous 68% DMG bonus to all allies in addition to its already powerful 50% Break Efficiency. While it is no small feat to achieve such a high Break Effect stat, the mere fact that it\u2019s possible to do so puts Ruan Mei\u2019s supportive capabilities right at the top alongside Bronya and Tingyun.Eidolon-wise, it\u2019s complete overkill in all cases. E1 is great value because it also gives allies a 20% DEF ignore during the Ultimate, but again, it\u2019s opulence to excess.\u00a0Ruan Mei\u2019s buffs all play extremely well with other Harmony supports due to not affecting ATK at all and having two different buffs that fully stack with one another. Combine her with Asta or Hanya and you\u2019ll supercharge a damage dealer and make them a speed demon, or combine her with Tingyun and make a damage dealer\u2019s Ultimate frequent and absurd. You can even just use her alongside Bronya and have what is likely to be the new defacto strongest hypercarry setup in the game.Ruan Mei is also very good at facilitating double carry comps, overtaking Asta in that regard, as being able to buff everyone on the team with no effort means that it\u2019s quite easy to keep two damage dealers strong throughout a fight, especially with Ruan Mei\u2019s excellent SP economy. This means that in Kafka DoT teams and Topaz follow-up teams, Ruan Mei is poised to be the leading lass in terms of Harmony supports, and the improvement from including her will be extremely stark.Usually, I talk about support characters\u2019 damage contribution as \u2018non-negligible\u2019 meaning it\u2019s a nice addition to have. Just by being in the team and being well-invested, Breaking of smaller enemies will cause them to simply explode into confetti, again by simply being in the party. The defensive benefits of Breaking enemies quickly and keeping them Broken for longer also cannot be understated, and she can end up greatly assisting lower investment sustain options to keep up by uhh, lemme check my notes here\u2026 \u2018Murdering things before they can murder you.\u2019 Yeah that sounds about right.The one truly big downside of Ruan Mei is the obscene investment she demands to reach her peak. As stated earlier, reaching 180% Break Effect is extremely challenging, even with sacrificing your Link Rope. Even if you do reach that amount or close to it, you\u2019ll likely be sacrificing a fair few defensive substats as well, so this is something you need to account for, even if it is partially solved by the increase in Break frequency she provides. Outside of her signature, her Light Cone options are also fairly dismal all things considered, so this should also be taken into account.With how Ruan Mei and Xueyi\u2019s kits are designed, it seems to be pointing at a potential shift in what is considered strong or even possible; the focus on Break for both of these characters is somewhat suspect, and I\u2019d advise keeping a close eye on the progression of Ruan Mei over time. Even without that potential future, Ruan Mei is a powerhouse of a Harmony unit, and you can\u2019t go wrong by trying to obtain her.Also, stop it, you can\u2019t fix her. Stop it."
