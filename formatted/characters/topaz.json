        "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - CRIT DMG = CRIT RateBoth CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are viable options for Topaz's body armour. Which is better will depend on which gives you a better CRIT ratio - use the one that does.Feet - SPD = ATK%SPD or ATK can be best for Topaz depending on the team you're running with her and your build. Just running SPD boots on top of Topaz's base Speed of 110 allows her to hit the standard breakpoint of 134 meaning all other speed sub-stats and bonuses are wasted. If you are able to hit 134 without the use of Speed boots then you can run ATK% instead for a huge damage increase. The most common time this happens is when running Topaz with Asta as Asta grants an immense amount of Speed - so much that Topaz no longer needs any of her own to reach not only 134 speed but even 161 speed. If you can reach your desired breakpoint without SPD boots go with ATK if you want to play it safe or you can't use SPD boots.Planar Sphere - ATK% = FIRE DMG %ATK% and FIRE DMG% offer similar damage boosts for Topaz. In solo situations without many party buffs ATK% is slightly ahead but with heavy team buffs from Asta or Tingyun FIRE DMG% pulls slightly ahead. Use the one with the better sub-stats.Link Rope - ATK%ATK% Rope is the only viable option.Additional notes for sub-statsCRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are Topaz\u2019s best damage scaling stats - shoot for the standard 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG. Topaz can afford to be a little below the usual CRIT RATE ratio thanks to her ultimate granting CRIT DMG - especially when using her signature as it also gives CRIT DMG not shown on the character sheetATK%: Topaz has no bonuses to ATK% in her kit so compared to other characters ATK% is comparatively far more valuable to her. Stacking it on SUB stats or Main stat pieces is a good damage increase and should not be neglected after getting a suitable CRIT ratio.DMG%: Generic and elemental DMG % isn\u2019t bad on Topaz but she already gets a massive amount of it for free from her Kit, the best relic sets: and Light Cones. A standard maxed-out Topaz fighting a fire-weak enemy with her signature gets 92% without using a FIRE DMG% Orb so getting more than this suffers from diminishing returns:22.4% Traces10% Fire Set Bonus15% Bonus Ability Vs Fire30% Signature15% SalsottoSpeed: Speed isn\u2019t bad on Topaz but most of her damage comes from Numby - and because Numby\u2019s speed is fixed and her allies have the ability to advance Numby\u2019s action it isn\u2019t as strong as it is on other characters. Speed still provides damage and quality of life though and thanks to her high base speed value it is a waste not to hit the standard breakpoints."

Still, if you're playing Topaz as an SP-neutral character, weaving her Basic into the rotation, this set will perform better.Firesmith of Lava-Forging + The Ashblazing Grand DukeIf you're still farming the new Ashblazing set, you can combine it with Firesmith and it will still yield better results than the old combinations.Firesmith of Lava-Forging + Musketeer of Wild WheatThe best 'old meta' pick for Topaz, but sadly with the release of Ashblazing it's getting outperformed badly.Musketeer of Wild WheatThe 4-piece Musket is a good, accessible, alternative compared to the mix-and-match set which is difficult to acquire. The Atk% is perfect for Topaz but the SPD is not always needed and sometimes goes on to be wasted unless pursuing a Speed breakpoint higher than 134 Speed which will affect this sets performance overall.Firesmith of Lava-ForgingSuffers from the same problems as the 4-piece Musket but offers less damage potential and is harder to farm making it a small downgrade overall.Inert SalsottoBy far Topaz's best planar set thanks to the CRIT RATE and generic damage boosts to her entire Kit's damage from the follow-up attack multiplier.Firmament Frontline: GlamothWorks great on Topaz if you can reach the Speed breakpoints.Space Sealing StationFalls slightly behind Inert Salsotto for Topaz and makes achieving a good CRIT ratio a lot more difficult. As your gear improves and you run Topaz with supports this set also falls even further behind because of diminishing returns. Still her 2nd best option for now though."

    "review": {
        "formatted": "Topaz is a unique hybrid of a secondary damage dealer and dedicated support for units with follow-up attacks (emphasis on support). She is capable of significantly increasing the follow-up damage a single enemy can receive indefinitely, with the increase to damage being a separate multiplier in most instances, resulting in an even larger increase. She also contributes fairly decent direct and Toughness damage of her own, and can use SP with a high degree of flexibility, even being able to be fully SP positive. Her biggest downside is that she is exclusively single-target focused and can struggle in even 2 target scenarios. Her personal damage output also relies on enemies getting hit by follow-ups, limiting her usefulness as a secondary damage dealer for non follow-up centric units.As a tax collector for the IPC, Topaz doesn\u2019t exactly make the best first impression, after all, tax evasion is an obligation (for legal reasons this is a joke). As a playable unit, Topaz is also somewhat intriguing. She is our first dedicated support character for the follow-up mechanic, meaning by design she is already slotting herself into a very specific type of gameplay and with very specific teammates.I will mention immediately that Topaz is not a particularly flashy character, nor is she really a character that is able to work out of the box as well as other hypercarries - at least as of the initial time of writing this. She is primarily a support character. Outside of her great single-target damage, she also doesn\u2019t tend to contribute as much as other units do for double or triple carry setups that don't rely on follow-up attacks - she really is tailor-made for teams with dedicated characters that can abuse her debuff. Within those follow-up teams, Topaz can elevate both her own and her teammates' damage output quite considerably, and is likely to become a mainstay for units like Jing Yuan, Clara, and maybe even Himeko too. Just know immediately that outside of those specific setups, you should not expect Topaz to be replacing any units you are likely already utilizing in other teams.With that out of the way, let\u2019s discuss what makes Topaz good in her specific teams. Topaz\u2019s Skill is the most important tool in her kit. It will deal follow-up damage up to 150% of Topaz\u2019s ATK to a single enemy target, and additionally inflict them with a debuff called Proof of Debt, which increases the damage they take from follow-up attacks by up to 50% at max Trace level. This 50% is in most cases a separate multiplier, meaning it takes effect after everything else has been calculated and will result in a significantly higher increase to damage than you may expect. Damage amps like this are incredibly rare and are extremely potent. The Proof of Debt debuff itself lasts indefinitely until either the target enemy is defeated or Topaz uses this Skill on another foe. If no enemy has Proof of Debt when an ally\u2019s turn begins or when they act, Proof of Debt will be randomly applied to one of the remaining enemies.Her Talent is her pet Trotter, Numby. Numby is very similar to Jing Yuan\u2019s Lightning-Lord in that it is a summoned entity with its own SPD value and turn order, and will disappear if the summoner is downed in combat. On Numby\u2019s turn, it will deal damage up to 150% of Topaz\u2019s ATK to a single enemy that has been afflicted with Proof of Debt. Numby\u2019s SPD is 80 by default, making it fairly slow to act, but whenever enemies afflicted with Proof of Debt receive an ally\u2019s follow-up attack, Numby will have its action Advanced Forward by 50%, resulting in it getting to act far more frequently than you may initially be led to believe. Note, this Advance Forward cannot be triggered on Numby\u2019s own turn, so this effect relies on your team being able to use follow-ups.Topaz\u2019s Ultimate buffs Numby for 2 turns. Numby enters the Windfall Bonanza! State, exclamation mark included, and its damage multiplier increases by up to 150%. It also benefits from an additional 25% CRIT DMG. Similar to Clara\u2019s Ultimate, Topaz\u2019s Ultimate temporarily lessens the restrictions on her Talent\u2019s Advance Forward activation; while Windfall Bonanza! is active, when enemies with Proof of Debt are hit by ally Basic ATKs, Skills, or Ultimates, Numby will have its action Advanced Forward by 50% as well. This means it\u2019s very easy to have Numby acting nearly back to back during its Enhanced state, as you temporarily do not need to rely on exclusively follow-up attacks to trigger the Advance Forward.Her Bonus Ability Traces improve her performance quite considerably. Her A2 Bonus Ability will transform her Basic ATK into a follow-up attack, meaning it will now also benefit from Proof of Debt\u2019s damage amp, as well as accelerating Numby\u2019s next attack with the Advance Forward. Her A4 will grant her and Numby 15% increased DMG against all enemies with a Fire Weakness, and her A6 will regenerate an additional 10 Energy for herself when Numby attacks under Windfall Bonanza!, effectively reducing the amount of Energy she needs to use her Ultimate again.Eidolons are not necessary for Topaz, and while they\u2019re not really that bad at all, they\u2019re also not really worth chasing extra copies of Topaz to get. E1 is good value if you\u2019re really adamant about going for Eidolons, as it can increase the CRIT DMG of follow-ups against Proof of Debt debuffed enemies by 25%, stacking up to 2 times.The gameplay plan becomes fairly simple: afflict the primary enemy target, usually a Boss or Elite, with the Proof of Debt debuff, and then pelt them with as many follow-up attacks as possible to get Numby to sic \u2018em as often as possible. Rather surprisingly, this is in fact as easy as it sounds as far as Topaz herself is concerned. Her Skill counts as a follow-up attack, and with her first Bonus Ability, her Basic ATK also functions as a follow-up attack, so every time Topaz acts, it\u2019s going to be Advancing Forward Numby\u2019s turn.This Advance Forward mechanic is the reason why Topaz benefits greatly from allies with follow-up attacks in their kit as well, as it can even further increase the number of times Numby will attack, creating a sort of feedback loop wherein Topaz buffs the ally follow-up attacks and gets increased personal damage output in the process. Even with the more infrequent follow-ups like from Jing Yuan\u2019s Lightning-Lord, the difference in Topaz\u2019s personal damage output is quite noticeable.She can use SP however you need once an enemy is afflicted with Proof of Debt; using Skill will consume 1 SP but will give greater damage, Energy gain, and Toughness damage, but using Basic ATK will deal only slightly less of each while recovering 1 SP instead. Since both count as follow-up attacks, Numby is always benefitting. Numby itself is also doing good Toughness damage every time it attacks, meaning together with Topaz, the amount of Toughness damage being dealt to a single foe is actually really quite high. It is not uncommon to be breaking extremely frequently with Topaz in the party as long as the enemy is Fire weak.As mentioned early on, Topaz is exclusively single-target focused, as is tradition for Hunt characters. With the climate of the game being extremely focused on Blast and AoE scenarios, this is quite a heavy limitation to be faced with, and is somewhat circumvented by pairing her with her intended follow-up heavy teammates, as their follow-ups are all AoE. This way, Topaz can safely mark the main Elite or Boss and have the ally follow-up attacks clear the field of trash adds. Attempting to utilise Topaz as a secondary damage source in teams without follow-ups, or as a solo hypercarry, will result in subpar performance compared to other damage dealers who can attack more than one target at the same time.Topaz is meant for follow-up teams, buffing other characters who also have follow-up attacks. By herself, Topaz is not comparable to most other dedicated damage dealers, to say nothing of the likes of Imbibitor Lunae or Jingliu. She does not have the types of intrinsic stat boosts or damage amps that many of those sorts of characters have, and so becomes incredibly reliant on having definitively good gear and Relics. Since many of her teams involve 2 damage dealers and a sustain option, it limits her access to buffs making good gear even more important, potentially even raising the quality requirement from good to great.Do not make the mistake of seeing the Hunt symbol and thinking she is comparable to the likes of Seele. Topaz is a support first, damage dealer second. If you do not already have the follow-up characters that work well with her, you should not reasonably expect her to perform to her best. If you are banking on getting Clara, or to a lesser extent Himeko, from the Regular Warp or its 300 pull guarantee, or are waiting for a Jing Yuan rerun to occur to guarantee him, then Topaz is a very solid investment, as those teams will likely have Topaz remain as a staple choice indefinitely from this point on. If you already have these characters, then you\u2019re set to benefit greatly from Topaz.If none of that applies to you, then really you should be asking yourself for what reason you\u2019re pulling for Topaz. If it\u2019s just because you like her character, design, or aesthetic, then hey, I get it, you do you. But if your reasoning is because of some hypothetical future characters that might benefit from what Topaz offers, then that may not be a compelling enough reason, especially if that decision involves a conversation about real-life spending. As the Trailblazer themselves say, \u2018When there is the chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won\u2019t regret\u2019.For the rest of us who have teams ready for her, Topaz herself is likely to continue to improve over time, especially seeing as she has a very rare and powerful debuff, but as was said with Kafka, the character\u2019s strength must be evaluated based on what they can do now. If something changes and Topaz gets verifiably better, you can trust me to keep this review updated.Oh and she powercreeps Simulated Universe. Small chance to obtain a whole damn Curio after defeating enemies with her Technique active? Sheeesh."
