After the wearer uses Basic ATK, Skill, or Ultimate to attack an enemy target, there is a 60% base chance to inflict \"Unarmored\" on the target. While in the Unarmored state, the enemy target receives 10% increased DMG, lasting for 2 turn(s). If the target is under a DoT state inflicted by the wearer, there is a 60% base chance to upgrade the \"Unarmored\" state inflicted by the wearer to the \"Cornered\" state, which additionally increases the DMG the target enemy receives by 14%, lasting for 2 turn(s). During this period, the wearer cannot inflict \"Unarmored\" on the target. "
