Bronya when Speed-tuned to be slightly slower than Boothill (at least 1 Speed slower) can double his actions in combat addressing the aforementioned flaws and also tremendously boost his damage by literally double in most cases. Running Bronya traditionally requires some sacrifices to character rotations in order to make the team skill points work, but when run with Boothill that's less of an issue thanks to his empowered Basic Attack not consuming skill points. Unless you're rapid-fire slaying enemies and refreshing his Standoff every action, Bronya makes for an incredible teammate for Boothill with her only downside being that due to her high Skill Point consumption, she limits the use of other powerful supports such as Harmony MC."

Ruan Mei's benefits for Boothill don't stop there though, her 50% Break Efficiency allows Boothill to start triggering his bonus Physical Breaks much sooner and consistently, and of course, stacks multiplicatively with his Talent, yielding by far the biggest Toughness damage hits in the game. Finally, Ruan Mei grants a bit of extra Ice break damage when Boothill nails a break bar but also Ruan's delay will allow Boothill's Physical Break Bleeds to trigger far more frequently - once when the enemy moves and then another after they recover from the delay shortly after."

The only drawback of this powerful combo is opportunity cost - Boothill's biggest weakness as mentioned in the Bronya synergy is his single-target nature and reliance on shredding enemies' break bars before dealing damage. Harmony Trailblazer can help Break enemies sometimes (only if they are Imaginary weak) but doesn't really help with the single target issue. By slotting in Harmony Trailblazer in the team you won't have enough Skill Points to also run Bronya, meaning you have to pick and choose whether you'd rather like way bigger numbers or way more actions."

It's completely reasonable to have enemies get Broken by allies and then to roll up like 'g'day mate' and blow their br \u2014 I mean uh, give them a goodnight kiss from the galactic homie (it's for the forever sleep he's sending them to).\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"If you're still worried about that, enter Boothill's Ultimate.

If your Boothill is particularly fast, it's very reasonable to expect that you can keep the Ultimate's Weakness Implant up pretty much 100% of the time on a major enemy.

E2 refunds a Skill Point whenever he obtains Pocket Trickshot and grants 30% BE for 2 turns (this also works when overcapping but you can only trigger this once per turn). E4 gives enemies in Standoff a DMG Vulnerability of 12% when attacked by Boothill, and Boothill himself only takes 3% more DMG instead of 15% from the duelled target.

Because of this, you really don't need to care about stats like CRIT or ATK since they're not relevant to increasing his damage, and this makes Boothill quite a bit easier to build overall, especially since it lets you utilise previously doomed mainstat Chest and Planar Sphere pieces that have DEF%.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"This does come with an interesting new issue though: what Light Cone do I even use?

The only Hunt Light Cone that's tailored for Break is unsurprisingly Boothill's signature, so what should free-to-play players do?\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"The solutions are either River Flows in Spring, the 4-star fully free Light Cone, or Adversarial. Yes, the 3-star Light Cone. Yes, really. Defeating an enemy gives you up to 18% SPD for 2 turns. You don't need to care about the low base ATK because it's not relevant for the damage he deals. The base HP and base DEF definitely do hurt, but you can mitigate this with defensive stats on Relics. River Flows in Spring is also good for a more consistent 12% SPD boost at S5, and has better defensive base stats than Adversarial.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"These are astonishingly good choices for casual players, but their conditions are quite steep. I wouldn't advise just anyone to try to make these work because it can lead to quite a frustrating experience; Adversarial stops working against big Bosses or Elites that don't summon adds to kill, and River Flows in Spring stops functioning for 2 turns if you take DMG. Of these two, River Flows in Spring is a clear winner if you're using Boothill alongside a Shielder like Aventurine, since the criteria for voiding the passive is specifically taking DMG; you can get hit so long as it doesn't go through the shield. It's unlikely you\u2019ll be using Aventurine here, since Gallagher is pretty much the best-in-slot sustain character for Boothill, but it is an option.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Since the Herta Hunt Light Cone, Cruising in the Stellar Sea, is omnipresent and in extremely high demand for a lot of Hunt DPS, it's quite likely that if you've been playing for even a small amount of time, you'll already have units who are contesting this free 5-star Light Cone. Having said that, if nobody else needs it, Cruising provides the most consistent baseline performance, and is a very good option for players not going for Boothill's signature Light Cone. This is especially true for players who do not wish to gamble on the inconsistency of the alternative free options, however good they may be.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"In terms of teammates, Boothill actually has a lot of options because of his self-contained kit, but there are unsurprising victors when it comes to his best choices.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\" Bronya in particular is a great support for him because more Actions for Boothill significantly increases his damage output, and will also facilitate his absurd Toughness damage to get enemies primed for maximum damage more quickly. Ruan Mei also achieves a similar effect through her Weakness Break Efficiency, albeit at slightly less overall impact, since Ruan Mei's SPD boost is far lower than the effective SPD Bronya can provide with her 100% Action Advance, and two turns of 150 Toughness each is more than a single turn of 225. Bronya is more SP intensive but Boothill's natural SP efficiency can counteract that.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Neither of the generic DMG or CRIT buffs these supports provide meaningfully impact Boothill's damage output, and it is their secondary effects that make them extremely worth taking. One support who does significantly impact Boothill's damage while also contributing their own is the recently attained Harmony Trailblazer. The Break Effect they provide directly increases the DMG Boothill's Talent deals, and the Super Break the Trailblazer's Ultimate provides will let Boothill decimate his foes even more quickly.

This is another point for Ruan Mei thanks to her Ultimate, but it also includes the likes of Pela and Silver Wolf. Both of these Nihility debuffers can reduce enemy DEF quite easily and consistently, greatly improving the Break DMG Boothill can do, but I want to put particular attention on Silver Wolf; she is entirely single-target focused, but since Boothill is too, it's not that big of a deal, and Silver Wolf provides a greater DEF shred than Pela does. The other benefit is that Silver Wolf can also implant Weaknesses onto enemies, Physical for Boothill while he waits for his Ultimate to come back, or Quantum to enable Boothill to fully utilise the 4 piece benefits of the Genius of Brilliant Stars Relic set. Especially if you are looking to erase Bosses, Silver Wolf is a great pick if you have her.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Lastly, the absolute best choices for a sustain for a Boothill team are the aforementioned Gallagher and Aventurine. Gallagher's Talent just straight-up increases the team's Break DMG by up to 12%, and the only cost of this is doing what you were already going to be doing. Gallagher himself also deals a silly amount of Toughness damage, so especially if the enemy is weak to Fire, he's a great pick, and he's a 4-star character, so he's quite accessible. Aventurine is pretty universally good but you're more likely to be using him with Boothill if you're looking to maximise the benefits of River Flows in Spring (the Light Cone from before). \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"The other notable benefits of both Gallagher and Aventurine is that they have no trouble sustaining the entire team while being completely SP positive, and that they contribute a huge amount of Toughness damage themselves. The SP is not something you need to worry about for Boothill himself, but something that is of extreme value when you consider that Boothill\u2019s best amplifying support options are quite SP hungry themselves (Bronya, Harmony Trailblazer). The Toughness damage also means that especially if enemies are weak to both Physical and either of the elements of the two sustains mentioned, it just makes Boothill even more easy to pilot. You can use any sustain you want, but these two are leagues ahead of the rest for the Galaxy Ranger.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Beyond that, there's not much else to say.

Fortunately, one such method of scaling is DEF shred which the Quantum set provides a good amount of. Against Quantum weak enemies this set is Boothill's current best performer and even against non-quantum weak enemies while it does fall behind some other sets on this list, it's still a reasonable boost. What makes this set a little more appealing is that its performance only increases the more DEF shred you get, something Boothill is interested in already - in fact his Signature and some of his Eidolons have quite a bit of it."
