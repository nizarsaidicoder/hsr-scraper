The most important of which is enabling Gallagher to deal tremendous Super Break damage. Outside of Aventurine, Gallagher has some of the most potent Toughness damage potential of all of the sustains thanks to his ultimate + basic spamming combos but unlike Aventurine, Gallagher stacks Break Effect himself to boost his healing meaning you can expect some truly threatening Super Breaks from the bartender. Again similar to Aventurine, Gallagher has good potential to be played skill point positive in a variety of situations allowing for skill useage as needed on Trailblazer."
