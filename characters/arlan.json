If the HP consumption is a flat amount, then having more HP will greatly offset the cost. However, if the HP consumption is via a fixed percentage of the character\u2019s Max HP as is the case with Arlan, then DEF far outweighs HP because having more HP will just see the char burn through it faster. So for Arlan to have above-average base HP only to have the worst DEF stat of any character in the game is\u2026 Just why though?\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"His Minor Traces are equally questionable, giving him HP boosts again instead of DEF. The Major Ability Traces attempt to alleviate some of the pain of managing his playstyle but don\u2019t really end up doing too much in practice. His A2 will restore 20% Max HP to Arlan upon killing an enemy if his current percentage is at or below 30%.

E2 is actually quite useful at removing pesky debuffs like ATK downs or Guardian Shadow\u2019s Bans, but ironically does nothing against crowd control, since you actually need to be able to act to take advantage of this.

The reason so many bemoan the nerfs Arlan received upon the game\u2019s launch compared to his performance in the final closed beta test is not because his damage is suddenly in the dumpster, it\u2019s because it feels like it\u2019s no longer justified by the rest of his kit.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"If you\u2019re looking to make use of Arlan, your main goal is making sure that he does not die before the enemy.
