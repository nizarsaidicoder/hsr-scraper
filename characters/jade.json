Well, for the low cost of a second copy of Jade, you can rectify these downsides. Jade's E1 increases the DMG% of her follow-up by 32%, and makes it so that she gains additional points of Charge if the Debt Collector character attacks fewer than 3 enemies, 1 extra if 2 enemies were hit, and 2 extra if 1 enemy was hit.
