Aim to maintain a ratio of 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG with a good stat line in endgame being 80% CRIT RATE and 160% CRIT DMG to start with. Feet - ATK% > SpeedMost of Acheron's damage comes from her Ultimate which unlike other characters can be fuelled by her team. The result of this is Acheron's own Speed is less important to her compared to other characters making ATK% boots more than viable on her. Acheron can still generate her own ultimate energy so Speed isn't useless making it a matter of player preference unless 160-Speed Sparkle is being used in which ATK% boots are always correct. Planar Sphere - ATK% > Lightning DMGAcheron gains 90% DMG for free from her kit and many of her top Cone options including her signature have yet more DMG% making ATK% a better option in many cases for her on Planar Sphere. Link Rope - ATK%Best in Slot.Additional notes for sub-statsSPEED: When playing Acheron lower speed values are viable as she gains a large portion of her damage from her ultimate which her team plays a substantial part in activating. For general-purpose gameplay base Speed or 134 Speed is recommended unless playing with 160 Speed Sparkle in which base Speed is always recommended. CRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: Similar to most Hit Based damage dealers Acheron scales incredibly well on CRIT. Aim to maintain a ratio of 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG with a good stat line in endgame being 80% CRIT RATE and 160% CRIT DMG to start with. ATK% & DMG%: Acheron gains a tremendous amount of DMG% for free from her kit (90% from her Bonus ability) and top Light Cone options (72% from S5 Goodnight Sleep Well or 48% from her Signature). Because of this ATK% is comparatively more powerful than usual for her and outstrips DMG% making it a high priority after securing a strong CRIT Ratio.

            "formatted": "Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters4P Pioneer is by far the best set for Acheron and by a large margin. She can easily activate the standard 2P and 4P bonuses as all of her teams are focused on debuffing the enemy as much and frequently as possible. Acheron also consistently applies a debuff herself with her Ultimate which she gains access to every 1 - 2 actions she takes in her most optimal team compositions meaning the 4P bonus is doubled almost all the time. When using her signature or other debuffing Light Cone the doubling bonus of the 4P bonus is always active without question. Band of Sizzling Thunder2nd best set for Acheron but substantially behind 4P Pioneer. Can be used if it's all you have or you have a set with excellent sub-stats. Musketeer of Wild WheatEasy to access alternative to 4P Lightning and 4P Pioneer but is behind both of them in performance. The passive Speed bonus is nice if you're struggling for Speed sub-stats but can be wasted if you already have your Speed breakpoint covered without the need for it or are using Sparkle. Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm Requires the equipped character to have another teammate of the same path on their team in order to be competitive. Acheron herself has this requirement already and as such Izumo's bonus can be activated for free. That bonus also happens to be the strongest for Acheron by a large margin making it her clear best in slot with no downside or concessions needed. Space Sealing StationSimilar in performance to Glamoth and another good generic alternative for Acheron. Pulls slightly ahead of 135-Speed Glamoth thanks to the fact Acheron scales better with ATK% than DMG% in most team compositions. Firmament Frontline: GlamothA reasonable option with similar power to Space Sealing Station for Acheron assuming she can achieve at least 135 speed. If playing Acheron with 160-Speed sparkle this set should be avoided. Inert SalsottoFalls behind alternatives despite having a large bonus to Ultimate damage alongside CRIT RATE as Acheron already has huge access to DMG% from her kit and Light Cone options making ATK% more desirable in most cases. Rutilant ArenaWorse bonuses than Salsotto with all the same downsides. "

            "formatted": "Acheron is an extraordinarily powerful DPS character, rivaling even Jingliu. She has a unique Ultimate which works on a stack-based system instead of the usual Energy mechanic. Stacks are gained whenever Acheron uses her Skill or when allies apply debuffs on enemies. Acheron also boasts some of the absolute highest self-buffing capabilities, with the only requirement being to have two other Nihility units alongside her. She also reduces enemies\u2019 All-Type RES during her Ultimate and even reduces their Toughness regardless of type. All of this together makes Acheron an absurdly potent and near-universally applicable DPS.Definitely not Raiden Mei made quite the entrance in the early story of Penacony, and now we finally get a glimpse at what she\u2019s capable of. Spoiler: It\u2019s a lot. Let there be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that Acheron is inarguably vying for the top DPS spot. She is literally just Lightning Jingliu, and this might be one of the most cut-and-dry DPS reviews in a while.I will actually lead off by saying that Acheron is a very challenging unit to play properly. It takes a lot of attention to detail to make the most out of her kit, and even though her damage ceiling is pretty much the new highest in the game, it does not necessarily come easily. If you do not take the time to learn her kit and how it works, you should not expect her to perform to her best. She\u2019s very worth the effort, but it has to be said either way. You have been warned.Her Ultimate is the most intriguing part of her kit, but we actually need to talk about her Talent first so that it makes sense. Yeah I know, but this is the way it is sometimes. The first part of Acheron\u2019s Talent states that her Ultimate can be used upon reaching 9 points of Slashed Dream, and the Talent additionally reduces all enemies All-Type RES by up to 20% during Acheron\u2019s Ultimate. 1 point of Slashed Dream can be obtained by Acheron herself through her Skill and through allies applying debuffs on enemies.The next part of her Talent involves stacking Crimson Knot on enemies. Whenever allies apply debuffs on enemies, in addition to incrementing Slashed Dream, they will also inflict 1 stack of Crimson Knot. If multiple enemies are debuffed, only 1 point of Slashed Dream will be gained by Acheron, and the enemy with the highest number of Crimson Knot stacks will get an additional one. Whenever an enemy target leaves the field or is defeated while Acheron is alive, their Crimson Knot stacks will be transferred to the enemy with the highest number of Crimson Knot stacks.Crimson Knot is important for Acheron\u2019s Ultimate. Upon using Acheron\u2019s Ultimate, she will draw her blade and enter a targeting mode similar to what Destruction Trailblazer does in their Ultimate. She can unleash 3 giant slashes, being able to switch targets in between attacks, followed by an automatic finisher slash at the end called Stygian Resurge. Each of her 3 targeted Rainblades will remove up to 3 Crimson Knot stacks from the targeted enemy, increasing the damage the slash deals based on the stacks removed.\u00a0This totals out to be up to 372% ATK to a single enemy, and 300% ATK to all other enemies. This is an extreme amount of AoE damage all on its own, and it\u2019s not even the final form of the Ultimate yet. The finisher slash will remove all Crimson Knots and Crimson Knot cannot be reapplied during the Ultimate.The majority of the damage from the Ultimate actually stems from the AoE portion. The way it works is that the AoE portion deals damage based on how many stacks of Crimson Knot are removed by the targeted slashes. You have the ability to change your target during this Ultimate, so it is imperative that you target enemies with at least 3 Crimson Knot stacks on them for each and every slash or you will not get the full amount of listed damage. The Ultimate will straight up show you above the enemies\u2019 heads how many Crimson Knot stacks they have, but if you are really unsure, then genuinely you can just put her on Auto for the duration of the Ultimate and it will handle it for you. Her Auto AI is surprisingly good.Acheron\u2019s Skill will give her 1 point of Slashed Dream on use and deals damage in a Blast AoE, up to 160% ATK to the main foe and 60% ATK to adjacent targets. This assists her in getting her points of Slashed Dream but is too slow to rely on getting her Ultimate quickly without having debuffing teammates.Interestingly enough, her Technique is actually worth talking about. She attacks the enemy and instantly defeats them if they\u2019re a normal enemy. Yes, this works in the Simulated Universe too. If they\u2019re worthy enough to survive the immediate death, Acheron will deal 200% ATK to all enemies on the field, depleting Toughness regardless of Weakness Types, and will gain 1 stack of Quadrivalent Ascendance. This status will immediately refund 1 point of Slashed Dream after Acheron\u2019s Ultimate ends and stacks 1 Crimson Knot on a single random enemy, serving as a head start towards her next Ultimate. This triggers on every subsequent wave as well, meaning she gets free points and stacks every time more enemies come up.This AoE damage and free stacking will actually occur on every subsequent enemy wave too, meaning Acheron always has a leg up on her foes. You can also just spam it freely to look cool because it only consumes the Technique Point if you actually hit an enemy.Already it looks very impressive, but you may be wondering how likely you are to be doing good damage if you need to rely on having debuffing teammates instead of the usual Harmony characters like Ruan Mei, Tingyun, or Sparkle. This is where Acheron\u2019s Bonus Traces come in to elevate Acheron to a new and ridiculous height.Acheron\u2019s A2 makes it so that when entering battle, Acheron will immediately start with 5 points of Slashed Dream and will apply 5 stacks of Crimson Knot to a random enemy. This greatly speeds up the process of getting her first Ultimate. In addition to this, when Slashed Dream reaches its cap of 9, excess points of Slashed Dream will be stored in stacks of Quadrivalent Ascendance, up to a new max of 3 stacks. When Acheron\u2019s Ultimate ends, these stacks of Quadrivalent Ascendance are consumed to restore the equivalent number of Slashed Dream points. This essentially means that you can overcap on Slashed Dream by 3 points and not lose out on potential damage.Her A4 provides a bonus to damage dealt when there are other Nihility characters in the team. If there is 1 other Nihility character, Acheron\u2019s Basic, Skill, and Ultimate will deal 115% of the original damage, increased to 160% of the original damage if you have 2 other Nihility characters.\u00a0I want to make this explicitly clear; this is an entirely separate damage multiplier. This is a damage boost that operates outside the confines of the DMG formula, meaning it is not beholden to diminishing returns, operates as stated, and is applied after everything else has been considered. This is also the first of its kind, and is an absurd self-buff that rivals and even slightly exceeds what many of the strong Harmony units we have can provide.This is also for any Nihility units by the way \u2014 you don\u2019t have to stick to just the classic Pela and Silver Wolf, you can be free to do whatever ridiculous combination you want and it\u2019ll still work extremely well. This also means that as long as the characters you\u2019re considering for her team are Nihility, her teams are among the most flexible in the entire game, letting her essentially act as a pseudo-universal DPS due to her absurd damage numbers, RES ignore, and Toughness ignoring damage.\u00a0This remains true in the reverse situation as well; adding Acheron into an already existing Nihility team is completely effortless and requires literally no extra steps. You want to do a simple Acheron-centric team with someone like Pela and Welt? Easy-peasy. Perhaps you want to watch the fireworks with Guinaifen and Sampo? No problem at all. Or maybe you\u2019re just cultured and like tall women, and so want to put Acheron with Kafka and Black Swan, and if so, you\u2019re in luck, because It just works\u2122.\u00a0The other outstanding benefit of this Bonus Trace is that it means Acheron quite simply doesn\u2019t need or even necessarily want what the Harmony characters provide, meaning they are entirely free to be used by your second team. With Acheron in the mix, no longer will you have to carefully weigh up which team you\u2019re going to have to make weaker by not giving Ruan Mei or Bronya, which team won\u2019t have the endless SP of Sparkle, or the Energy gains of Tingyun. This will no longer be a consideration you need to make because it\u2019s all quite simple: you just put them on the team that Acheron isn\u2019t on.By restricting the activation of this Talent to only other Nihility units, Acheron frees up the best supports in the game to be used by other characters who need it far more than her, ironically becoming a far less restrictive unit than one might incorrectly assume. Even then, when your restriction is the entirety of a Path that is also notorious for doing whatever it damn well pleases\u2026 Well I just wouldn\u2019t even call that a restriction to be honest.Finally, Acheron\u2019s A6 just adds to this ridiculousness. When the Rainblade from Acheron\u2019s Ultimate hits enemy targets with Crimson Knot, her DMG increases by 30%, stacking up to 3 times and lasting for 3 turns. When Stygian Resurge ends the Ultimate, she will deal 6 additional instances of 25% ATK damage to a random enemy, and this damage is considered Ultimate damage.This means that over the course of her already brutal Ultimate, Acheron also gains a 90% DMG bonus as well as increasing the final multiplier by 150% ATK. Remember, of course, that all of this is in addition to the Talent\u2019s bonuses of reducing the All-Type RES of enemies by a whole 20% and having all the damage ignore Weakness Types too. Oh, and since the DMG bonus lasts for 3 turns, it\u2019s actually quite possible to have this be up almost indefinitely if the rest of the team can apply debuffs quickly enough for Acheron to regain points of Slashed Dream.This makes her Ultimate deal pretty impressive damage, comparable to the likes of an Imbibitor Lunae Fulgurant Leap or a fully stacked Lightning-Lord. As soon as there\u2019s 4-5 enemies showing up on the field, this Ultimate starts to run away with it and it becomes quite simply the single most devastating move in the entire game, and it\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not even remotely close.\u00a0I hesitate to even mention her Eidolons because quite frankly I think it\u2019s all whale-bait. Acheron is already basically the best DPS in the game at E0 \u2014 yes it does require some non-free units to really use since Hoyoverse have yet to make any 4-star Nihility units free, but still, it\u2019s a comparatively small price to pay compared to some other top dogs.Hear me now, anyone who says that Acheron needs Eidolons is both hilariously incorrect and afflicted with downright crippling Skill Issue. None of this is likely to ever be necessary because it\u2019s just a level of power that you\u2019ll literally never get to use. If you are just shilling for your queen, however, I have good news, since all of her Eidolons are pretty good past E1; her first Eidolon is a bit lacklustre given the insanity of her base kit, so it\u2019s mostly a stepping stone for later Eidolons.I called Acheron \u2018Lightning Jingliu\u2019 at the start of this and hopefully if you made it this far in the review you understand why. She takes a fair bit more to become unfathomably strong when compared to the Blademaster, but her ceiling is very similar. The best part is that Acheron and Jingliu can fully coexist since they want entirely different teams and setups.Like Jingliu, Acheron sees a remarkably high benefit from getting her Signature Light Cone, but unlike Jingliu, Acheron doesn\u2019t really have very good 4-star options at this time. You should know that if a Light Cone passive inflicts a debuff, it\u2019ll also grant Acheron 1 point of Slashed Dream, which means she\u2019s more drawn to Cones that can do that. Coupled with the insane amount of damage she gets from her Signature, it makes going for Acheron\u2019s Light Cone quite a compelling choice, especially since it also applies a debuff. Currently this lack of Light Cone options is a really big weakness that Acheron has.That said, she doesn\u2019t need her Signature Light Cone to perform extremely well. Acheron has some good 4-star options for Light Cones but they are unfortunately locked behind gacha, and the free Nihility Light Cones are more tailored towards the Damage over Time centric characters like Kafka. Do not fret too much, as even the super free-to-play options are still more than enough for Acheron to decimate everything, but you still want to keep an eye out for a copy of Good Night and Sleep Well, as well as keeping an eye out for any potential future Nihility Light Cones.Teammate-wise, a Preservation unit holding Trend of the Universal Market is technically the best option for maximum debuff spreading for the sustain choice, but it can be a tad unreliable on anyone that isn\u2019t the Preservation Trailblazer, since they can Taunt enemies into attacking them. It\u2019s a very meaningful optimisation, but is not worth running if it costs you overall survivability (such as if you don\u2019t have any other Preservation units and have been neglecting your Preservation Trailblazer). Gallagher is also released in this same patch and is an Abundance unit with debuffing capabilities, so he is going to be the next best choice in this regard if you do not own a copy of Trend of the Universal Market.Interesting to note as well, if you are lacking a compelling second other Nihility unit to use with her, but you have Sparkle, you can use her and get pretty decent results, but do note that if you choose to do this, your Sparkle has to be extremely well built to make up for the severe damage loss you incur by not fully activating Acheron\u2019s A4. If your Acheron is E2, Sparkle becomes her best teammate technically, but the damage is such overkill that bosses would need their health tripled or something ridiculous like that. It\u2019s not unconditionally better than just using the second Nihility character, so don\u2019t try and brute force it if you have options, because Sparkle is far better spent on other DPS characters who actually need her.Because of Acheron\u2019s universal strengths and versatile team comps, she\u2019s actually a character you may consider going for even if you already have other well-built DPS units \u2014 even if you already own a well-built Jing Yuan and Kafka. Acheron does what she does in a unique and powerful way, and she frees up all of your strong Harmony characters to be used on your second team. She definitely isn\u2019t as plug-and-play as some people would have you believe, you still need to actually invest in her and her teammates, and this can be tricky since another big draw of her Nihility teammates is that they\u2019ll be contributing their own damage to the team. They can\u2019t do that if they\u2019re not geared.The other thing to consider before pulling is \u2018do I actually even have enough good Nihility units to pair with Acheron?\u2019, because if the answer to that question is no, then you may need to think a little more about this, especially when also factoring in the aforementioned Light Cone woes you may encounter. Pela and Resolution Shines as Pearls of Sweat are pretty much the minimum you\u2019d need for it to be a real recommendation, but if you\u2019re expecting to get those soon, or if you simply don\u2019t mind all that much, then make your own decision.You have to remember that this is Acheron in her absolute base version without any specialised teammates, and she\u2019s already rivalling and even exceeding the best DPS characters we have right now. It can, quite literally, only go up from here, and that\u2019s somewhat terrifying actually. I mean think about it like this: any future Nihility unit has the potential to be paired with Acheron, and anything they provide is going to be passing through that final 1.6x multiplier from Acheron\u2019s A4.\u00a0Acheron is a teammate for life, and someone you can count on to be a top contender for a very long time, and if future Nihility units are tailored to her game plan, maybe even longer than that. The last thing I\u2019ll say is to be prepared to grind for her best equipment, because it all adds up a lot. If you settle for \u2018good enough\u2019, don\u2019t be surprised when she doesn\u2019t live up to what she\u2019s capable of.If you can meet those requirements, you\u2019ll have bonafide Lightning on your hands. Do you know why they say Lightning rarely strikes twice?\u2026 It\u2019s because she usually doesn\u2019t have to."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - CRIT DMG >= CRIT RateCRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are both ideal for Argenti - choose the one that offers you the best CRIT ratio.Feet - Speed > ATK%Speed is the safest option but ATK% can be strong when combining Argenti with supports that offer him speed like Hanya or Asta.Planar Sphere - Physical DMG > ATK%Physical% is best in most cases but ATK% isn't far behind so an ATK% orb with excellent sub-stats can be used.Link Rope - ATK%ATK% Rope is recommended as it is the only offensive scaling option available in this slot.Additional notes for sub-statsCRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: Those are Argenti's best damage scaling stats - shoot for the standard 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG. Argenti can afford to be below the usual CRIT RATE ratio thanks to his Talent granting a sizeable amount depending on the level it's at, level 10 grants a bonus 25% CRIT RATE which should be considered when deciding which CRIT stat to aim for.ATK%: Argenti has limited ATK% in his kit making it a reasonable stat to chase but only after a solid CRIT ratio has been established - think of it more like a bonus stat on the way to getting your CRIT pieces.DMG%: Argenti doesn't have much increased DMG% in his kit but his signature Cone and his next best option (Today Is Another Peaceful Day) make up for it. If you're using these Cones the value of dmg% diminishes somewhat especially compared to CRIT RATE stats.Speed: Speed as with most standard direct damage carries is incredibly important on Argenti - hitting a strong Memory of Chaos breakpoint is also advised when aiming to achieve the fastest and most comfortable endgame clears. Stacking Speed past your desired breakpoint isn't advised though. Higher breakpoints can more easily be achieved consistently by pairing Argenti with characters like Hanya and Asta. They may even allow you to switch out some gear pieces like your Speed boots in favor of more damage stats. Aim for any of the Speed breakpoints below baseline or with consistent support Speed buffs."

Also offers Attack which is a nice bonus.Musketeer of Wild Wheat + Champion of Streetwise BoxingAn alternative to the 4-piece Musketeer of Wild Wheat that depending on the Speed sub-stats or supports you have access to can be a better option situationally.Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + Champion of Streetwise BoxingAnother speed-based option and alternative to 4-piece Musketeer of Wild Wheat with the same upsides and downsides but offers 10% increased Physical Damage instead of 12% increased Attack which may be better or worse depending on your gears stats and the supports you are using.Firmament Frontline: GlamothStrongest stand-alone Planar Set for Argenti when at 135 speed but even more powerful at 160 speed if your team comp can achieve it. Does not have CRIT though so can fall behind other options in certain team compositions.Rutilant ArenaA strong CRIT option for AoE-based fights, offering a 20% damage increase to skills. The more enemies in the fight the more Argenti's skill becomes a large part of his damage making this set stronger.Space Sealing StationIn his base kit, Argenti has limited access to increased ATK% making Space Sealing Station a decent option for him if you already have it. This set falls behind CRIT sets when combining Argenti with a team of supports with a large amount of ATK% buffs. Inert SalsottoAnother strong CRIT set close in power to Rutilant arena that buffs Argenti's Ultimate instead of skill but only for 15% instead of 20% making it slightly weaker in AoE fights. If you use Argenti's signature this set loses a little value as his ultimate already receives so much increased % damage already."

            "formatted": "Argenti boasts the highest AoE damage in the game alongside remarkable ease of use. He does not deal the highest damage in single-target scenarios, but he is unmatched in AoE. His Ultimate can be used at 90 Energy for fast access to AoE damage, but is best used at the huge cost of 180 to be at maximum effectiveness, skyrocketing its upfront damage output and providing 6 extra damage Bounces. This makes his Ultimate powerful in all scenarios, and each Bounce will also deal some Toughness damage as well. With extra CRIT Rate and additional Energy gains from his Talent, Argenti is an exceptional damage dealer.With flowing locks and just the right amount of comedic cringe, Argenti certainly makes an interesting first impression. Erudition units are steadily becoming more and more appreciated, and Argenti is poised for success. He is a remarkably powerful damage dealer with a simple, yet effective kit.Argenti\u2019s Skill deals damage to all enemies on the field, up to 120% of his ATK at max Trace level. It\u2019s not exactly the most riveting ability in the game, but out of the similar Erudition Skills across the other characters, it does have the highest multiplier; 120% compared to the common 100% may not seem like a big improvement, but it starts to make a very big difference very quickly as the number of enemies increases.Argenti\u2019s Ultimate is the first of its kind. It is usable at two different Energy amounts, 90 and 180. At 90 Energy, he will deal minor damage to all enemies, a pretty decent amount for a low cost Ultimate. However, if you use his Ultimate at 180 Energy, he will instead deal substantially more damage to all enemies and subsequently deal 6 extra instances of single-target damage to a random enemy. This extra damage is in the form of a Bounce attack much like Asta or Sampo\u2019s Skills, meaning each hit will deal its own instance of Toughness damage. It is vitally important to note that each of these Bounces will ignore \u2018dead\u2019 targets, meaning no damage is going to be wasted on enemies whose health is already 0 after the first big swing.Combining these means that Argenti\u2019s 180-cost Ultimate deals an absurd amount of total damage, even against just a single target. If you\u2019re hitting 5 enemies, this Ultimate is nothing short of nuclear. Against AoE content, Argenti\u2019s going to be reaching damage numbers that belong in the Simulated Universe. Even in single-target scenarios, this Ultimate will deal very impressive damage as well as 120 Toughness damage, equivalent Toughness damage to that of an Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Fulgurant Leap.Understandably, you want to be utilising the max cost Ultimate as often as possible, but an Energy cost of 180 is excruciatingly steep. Luckily, Argenti\u2019s Talent helps to offset this somewhat. Every enemy that is hit by one of Argenti\u2019s attacks will restore 3 Energy. Again, this seems somewhat underwhelming but in conjunction with the Energy gains from using Argenti\u2019s Skill and the potential to get an extra 15 Energy per turn against 5 enemies, this talent goes a very long way to facilitating the otherwise exorbitant cost of Argenti\u2019s full Ultimate.Argenti\u2019s Talent will also grant a stack of Apotheosis per enemy hit, increasing his CRIT Rate by 2.5%. Apotheosis can stack up to 10 times, granting a total of 25% CRIT Rate permanently for the rest of the encounter. Due to the AoE nature of Argenti\u2019s damage, this is very easy to stack up to maximum within only a few turns, and having that much extra CRIT Rate for free is highly potent and very much appreciated.Argenti\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces are mostly nice bonuses. A2 will grant Argenti a stack of Apotheosis every time his turn starts, which is definitely good, but with the rate at which Apotheosis will stack during combat, this particular Bonus Ability goes largely unnoticed. A6 will let Argenti deal 15% more damage to targets whose health is at or below 50% of their maximum, which is largely self-explanatory.His A4 is particularly interesting. It states \u2018When enemy targets enter battle, immediately regenerates 2 Energy for self.\u2019 What this means is that any time a new enemy appears on the field for seemingly any reason, Argenti will get 2 Energy instantly. This understandably includes the start of a new enemy wave, but more impressive is that it also includes any summoned enemies or other reinforcements, such as those called by Boss Gepard or the unending slew of IPC goons called by the IPC Team Leader.Argenti\u2019s Eidolons are strong but unnecessary, as he\u2019s already going to be decimating pretty much everything the game can come up with to throw at the player. E1 is particularly good value, as it allows Apotheosis to also accumulate CRIT DMG bonuses in addition to its CRIT Rate.This Knight of Beauty is really quite simple to use, and that\u2019s arguably his best trait; Argenti doesn\u2019t need to worry about things like gaining stacks on a summoned entity, or making sure he has a large amount of Skill Points to be at full power, or making sure the enemy has been properly primed with damage over time. He just\u2026 does the thing. It just works\u2122. For some this may actually be a negative thing, since this simplicity also extends to his team setups and may become stale quickly, but over time, I\u2019m certain everyone can learn to appreciate the value of a straightforward unit.Units that help offset his tremendous Ultimate cost are naturally good pairs, such as Tingyun and Huohuo. Characters that can grant Argenti more actions can also offset the Ultimate\u2019s cost by proxy; Asta, Bronya, and Hanya can allow Argenti more opportunities to make use of his own Energy restoring Talent, thus increasing his total damage by quite a lot. Because of Argenti\u2019s simplicity, you can really kind of just do whatever you like when it comes to team setups and you\u2019ll probably be okay.\u00a0Argenti is honestly pretty great. You may not feel inclined to pull for him if you\u2019ve already got the super heavy hitters like Jingliu, Imbibitor Lunae, or Kafka, but trust, nobody destroys AoE like Argenti destroys AoE. What the hell is Idrila feeding her Knights, seriously, like damn."

            "formatted": "Arlan is a primarily single-target damage dealer that consumes health to deal damage instead of consuming Skill Points. His Ability multipliers are decently high, especially for a 4-star, but they come at the cost of needing to juggle Arlan\u2019s health for damage and survivability without Arlan having really any way of accommodating this himself.Arlan is odd, and a little misunderstood. He\u2019s definitely not the best unit in the game, to put it lightly, but he\u2019s often written off completely as \u2018unusable\u2019. Look I\u2019m going to level with you right off the bat, unless you quite literally have nobody else to level up, I guarantee you have better options to spend your extremely valuable and limited resources on. Arlan definitely has real use-cases but is overshadowed by other characters \u2014 not because he doesn\u2019t perform well in those scenarios, but because he simply requires too many things to facilitate his gameplay.Arlan\u2019s Skill deals up to 240% ATK to a single enemy and consumes 15% of Arlan\u2019s Max HP. If he doesn\u2019t have enough HP, his health will be set to 1 when using Skill.Two things to note here; the first is that while the actual text for Arlan\u2019s Skill says \u2018his HP will be reduced to 1\u2019 if he doesn\u2019t have enough health, it does in fact set his HP to 1 as mentioned previously, meaning that he may continue to use his Skill at no further penalty when he is already at 1 HP. The second thing to note is that this HP cost is in place of a Skill Point cost, meaning Arlan is quite literally incapable of using Skill Points for the purposes of any mechanics or interactions involving their consumption.Arlan\u2019s Ultimate is a Blast AoE that deals up to 320% ATK to the primary target and 160% to adjacent. It\u2019s a fairly low-cost Ultimate requiring only 110 Energy. It has a pretty substantial multiplier considering its cost as well.Arlan\u2019s Talent is what is supposed to be the reward for staying at lower HP values. Arlan\u2019s DMG increases for every percent below his Max HP up to a maximum bonus of 72% more DMG. This coupled with his surprising Ability multipliers should lead to pretty astounding damage in total, and this is partly true\u2026 The issue is that maintaining Arlan at low HP values is actually rather challenging without him immediately dying thereafter.This immediately leads to the next issue; Arlan\u2019s base stats are bloody awful, haha. I laugh to hide the pain, naturally, but this guy unironically has the worst DEF of literally any character, and he\u2019s the one they chose to be the berserker archetype. Oof, talk about getting done dirty. His ATK isn\u2019t the worst but it\u2019s also fairly low for a character like his, and the fact that his HP is the one that\u2019s above average is just another slap to the face.Let me elaborate. When a character is all about consuming their own HP, the way in which they do it determines which defensive stat is worth more to them, out of HP or DEF. If the HP consumption is a flat amount, then having more HP will greatly offset the cost. However, if the HP consumption is via a fixed percentage of the character\u2019s Max HP as is the case with Arlan, then DEF far outweighs HP because having more HP will just see the char burn through it faster. So for Arlan to have above-average base HP only to have the worst DEF stat of any character in the game is\u2026 Just why though?His Minor Traces are equally questionable, giving him HP boosts again instead of DEF. The Major Ability Traces attempt to alleviate some of the pain of managing his playstyle but don\u2019t really end up doing too much in practice. His A2 will restore 20% Max HP to Arlan upon killing an enemy if his current percentage is at or below 30%. This is the only HP restore in Arlan\u2019s entire kit, leading me to say very clearly that Arlan is an expert at throwing his life away and struggles immensely to regain it.A4 grants a passive 50% chance to resist DoT debuffs. This is only for the initial application of the debuff, it does exactly jack if you\u2019re already afflicted with the DoT. A6 essentially grants a damage barrier to Arlan if he enters battle with 50% or less HP, similar to what the Automaton Beetles have. This would have been a fantastic thing to have if you were ever actually able to utilise it at the endgame; you just never have the option of doing so, and Arlan\u2019s technique doesn\u2019t consume HP either.With Eidolons, Arlan\u2019s respectable damage goes up even higher, but regrettably, none of his issues with survivability get meaningfully solved. E1 gives a 10% DMG boost to his Skill if executed at or below 50% HP. E2 is actually quite useful at removing pesky debuffs like ATK downs or Guardian Shadow\u2019s Bans, but ironically does nothing against crowd control, since you actually need to be able to act to take advantage of this. E4 is also questionable as it gives Arlan a second chance after being knocked down but this only works for 2 turns after the battle has begun, disappearing into that good night if it\u2019s not used prior to that point.E6 is actually very notable. At or below 50% HP, his Ultimate will gain 20% DMG, and the DMG multiplier of the Blast AoE portion will be boosted up to the same amount as the primary target. This means his Ultimate is now dealing 320% ATK to 3 enemies, becoming a very potent AoE attack. Combined with the Ability Trace boosts from his E3 and E5, Arlan\u2019s Ultimate actually becomes pretty absurd.Now, at this stage I should reiterate that Arlan can do some very astonishing damage if he\u2019s well invested, and especially at E6. I will also reiterate that the damage has never been the issue with Arlan. The reason so many bemoan the nerfs Arlan received upon the game\u2019s launch compared to his performance in the final closed beta test is not because his damage is suddenly in the dumpster, it\u2019s because it feels like it\u2019s no longer justified by the rest of his kit.If you\u2019re looking to make use of Arlan, your main goal is making sure that he does not die before the enemy. You are essentially automatically signing up for a battle of attrition and the perfect defensive character does not yet exist for Arlan. Because of this, and his desire to stay at low HP values to max out his Talent, you are bottlenecked into using either March 7th or Gepard as the team\u2019s sustain. Arlan needs very beefy shields to stay alive, because when you\u2019re permanently at 1 HP, a sneeze will off you, let alone any of the nonsense moves like Decaying Shadow\u2019s \u2018sagacious discernment\u2019. Stacking defensive units will improve Arlan\u2019s survivability but will negatively impact the team\u2019s overall damage.Because of Arlan\u2019s inability to use SP, he makes for a great second damage dealer on a team, contributing a surprising amount of damage without needing much in the way of buffs due to his Talent already providing a large amount of percent DMG. Double carry teams are not exactly chic right now, even in the wake of Ruan Mei\u2019s release, but especially if you\u2019re covering for Elemental Weaknesses, this can be a very good way to make use of Arlan.You could also play Arlan as a hypercarry, again due to his quite impressive damage multipliers, though keep in mind that his desire for SPD can be questionable at best \u2014 a faster Arlan means he\u2019ll burn through shields quicker as well, so you need to make sure that your shielder is fast enough to be able to reapply those shields in a pinch. This also unfortunately rules out Bronya almost immediately since her Action Advance will just massacre any shields Arlan has on him.\u00a0If you are able to circumvent these issues for yourself and actually put Arlan to good use, you may be surprised by his performance. The unfortunate thing is that for the same amount of effort, you could play any of the other 4-star characters available to you, and last I checked, none of them seem so eager to maim themselves.But I\u2019ll end it with this; I like him. I even prefer him to Serval in a lot of cases. Do with this information what you will."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Asta is a universally applicable support specialising in increasing the whole team\u2019s ATK and providing a massive teamwide SPD boost. Her Ultimate increases SPD by a flat 50. Asta also benefits from a fairly strong Skill that Bounces damage between enemies, allowing her to stack up her ATK bonus easily and deal tremendous Toughness damage for a support.The Lead Researcher of the Herta Space Station has steadily become more and more recognised by the playerbase. Her kit is always appreciated and always powerful, and it\u2019s become very clear that she is one of the most versatile and useful support units in the game, even despite her status as a fully free character.Asta\u2019s Talent has you gain up to 5 stacks of Charging. You gain a stack for every hit against a different enemy, and you get 2 stacks if an enemy you hit is weak to Fire. Each stack of Charging increases the entire team\u2019s ATK by up to 14%, meaning the maximum total ATK boost is 70%. After her second turn in a fight, she\u2019ll lose 3 stacks of Charging at the start of every turn.\u00a0This is a very powerful boost that is quite easy to maintain at higher stacks. Even if there is only a single enemy on the field, you will always get to have at least a permanent 14% ATK boost since Asta\u2019s turns are spent either Basic Attacking or using her Skill, increasing to 28% permanently if the enemy is weak to Fire. This is also the amount you can expect if Asta is played exclusively SP positive. As soon as more enemies start showing up, Asta can start very easily racking up stacks of Charging each turn with her Skill.Her Skill is a Bounce attack; a multi hit attack where you land the first hit against your primary target and the remaining hits can randomly land on any target, including the original one. This deals up to 50% ATK to the first enemy and Bounces 4 times, each Bounce hit also dealing 50% ATK. Bounce attacks will also deal Toughness damage on each hit, with the hits beyond the first dealing a reduced amount. This Skill will end up dealing a total of 90 Toughness damage across its 5 hits, the same as most single-target Ultimates but on a Skill.With Asta\u2019s Skill it becomes possible to gain many Charging stacks easily, though with a slight amount of randomness involved. If you\u2019re against a full house of 5 enemies and are lucky, you can get 5 stacks of Charging by getting a hit off on each of them, even if none of them have a Fire Weakness. If any of them do have a Fire Weakness, it becomes a lot more consistent to gain 5 stacks, though as mentioned before, even a couple of stacks can already be significant.\u00a0This Skill even has a pretty impressive total multiplier of 250% ATK, particularly impressive against a single enemy. While Asta is not likely to be built specifically to deal damage, any damage stats that you do end up getting can actually end up being quite impactful in combat.Asta\u2019s Ultimate is extraordinarily potent, increasing the SPD of all allies by up to a flat 50 for 2 turns. Anyone who\u2019s familiar with turn-based games understands that any amount of additional Speed can be devastatingly powerful, and this is no exception. An additional flat 50 SPD is a huge increase for every character, and all of them except for maybe Clara greatly appreciate this.\u00a0For many characters, SPD is of paramount importance as it streamlines gameplay and rotations, increasing overall ease of performance. At lower SPD values, some characters can range from \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 to \u2018virtually unusable\u2019, and getting more SPD is a tough ask as it\u2019s one of the rarest substats in the game. Asta can completely alleviate this issue and then some.However, this does not mean that the value brought by Asta\u2019s Ultimate is in any way diminished by characters who already meet their necessary SPD thresholds. As this boost is teamwide, everyone benefits from this, including Asta herself. Against many high level enemies, without a sufficient amount of SPD you\u2019ll be getting lapped several times over and might end up falling as a result \u2014 your support characters also need to be fast to keep up with your fast damage dealers and especially against the ever accelerating enemies.\u00a0At the higher end, for characters that are already exceeding their designated SPD values by a lot and reaching above 150, it is possible to exceed the 200 mark with Asta, thus transcending into double turn territory, something that is practically impossible to attain without Asta, as most character\u2019s Base SPD values are just too low.It is important to understand that you can end up fumbling Asta\u2019s Ultimate somewhat; it\u2019s not correct to call it \u2018misusing\u2019 but there is a rather steep prerequisite to understanding how to use this Ultimate optimally, and that\u2019s actually knowing how SPD works. Many have tried to explain this before, and it\u2019s a concept that can get very messy and complicated.Instead, here\u2019s the cheat sheet for using Asta\u2019s Ultimate: go to your settings and enable \u2018Display Action Values\u2019 and you\u2019ll see some numbers in the turn order that\u2019ll essentially show how far away the next turn is. When the number is bigger, use the Ultimate, it\u2019ll end up pushing your characters\u2019 turns up more. There is also a peculiar interaction where if you use this Ultimate on a character\u2019s turn before they act, they\u2019ll end up getting an \u2018extra turn of the SPD boost\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s not actually an extra turn of it, it\u2019s more of a safety measure to prevent you from completely wasting a turn of the SPD boost.Aside from that one peculiarity, there\u2019s really no wrong way of using Asta. Hell, you could decide to not care about optimising the Ultimate and she\u2019ll still be one of the best supports in the game. None of her supportive benefits scale off of anything besides Trace level, meaning it\u2019s up to the player how they want to build her; going for a more offensive playstyle with CRIT, or going full tank with 6000+ HP, it doesn\u2019t matter one bit as long as she\u2019s staying alive long enough to get her support out.Asta\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces can be quite useful. Her A2 gives her Basic ATK an 80% base chance to Burn enemies for 3 turns, making them take 50% of Asta\u2019s Basic ATK in damage. This deals quite literally no meaningful damage, but it is a source of a debuff which can be potentially useful for certain character synergies like Guinaifen\u2019s Firekiss. A4 will increase all allies\u2019 Fire DMG by 18% while Asta is alive, which is a free and appreciated boost to Fire centric teams or damage dealers. A6 is probably the most generally useful one of the bunch as it increases Asta\u2019s DEF by 6% per stack of Charging, potentially giving a 30% DEF boost for free, aiding in her survivability further.Asta is already superb at E0, and while she doesn\u2019t necessarily get a huge performance boost from Eidolons, she does get some pretty significant improvements to her overall usability. E1 will add an extra Bounce to her Skill, increasing the damage to 300% ATK, the Toughness damage to 105, and offering an extra chance to get more Charging stacks. E2 is a very big milestone as it will delay the decay of Charging stacks for 1 turn after using her Ultimate, letting her maintain higher stacks of Charging for longer without spending as much SP, and also allowing to nicely line up all of her benefits for big bursts from your damage dealers.E4 will increase Asta\u2019s Energy Regeneration Rate by 15% when she has 2 or more Charging stacks. This is easily her most impactful Eidolon, as this can allow for permanent Ultimate uptime with certain builds. E3 and E5 are very impactful for Asta as a support character, increasing her Charging stacks ATK boost to 15.4% per stack, and improving her Ultimate\u2019s SPD boost to a flat 53 instead of 50. Even 3 extra SPD can be pretty significant so these ability level Eidolons should not be underestimated. E6 is the final comfort Eidolon, reducing the Charging decay to only 2 at the end of her turn instead of 3.Asta is pretty much the gold standard for support characters. There\u2019s almost no team that can\u2019t benefit from her inclusion and she even enhances overall accessibility while doing all of the other stuff. Some of the best performing teams in the game utilise Asta, and that is highly unlikely to change any time soon. If you have not invested in your Asta yet, this is your official message to stop coping and just do it already.No really, go do it. I\u2019ll wait."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - DEF% = CRIT DMG DEF% is recommended unless you can remain at or above 4000 DEF with a CRIT DMG Body Armour and Imaginary % Sphere equipped. If this is possible for your Aventurine you can choose to sacrifice larger shields for more damage. Feet - SPD = DEF% Both Speed and DEF% Boots are viable on Aventurine, depending on what your build and team need. Running Speed allows Aventurine to generate more skill points, have more frequent access to his skill and ultimate, and is essential in Follow-Up teams to ensure he continually gains Blind Bet stacks from his teammates without falling behind. If you're ok giving up the bonuses Speed provides, DEF% can be used to more easily reach 4000 DEF or in place of another main stat defensive piece like the Sphere or Body armour allowing a damaging option to be run in that slot. Planar Sphere - DEF% = IMG DMG% DEF% is recommended unless you can remain at or above 4000 DEF with an Imaginary % Sphere equipped. If this is possible for your Aventurine you can choose to sacrifice larger shields for more damage. Link Rope - DEF% In order to reach 4000 DEF, most Aventurine builds require a DEF% Rope and even the ones that don't would rather switch out other defensive main stat pieces for more damage before the Rope. This on top of the fact Aventurine's ultimate isn't essential to his gameplay like other sustains, means in most teams it's preferred not to use an energy recharge rope. Additional notes for Sub-statsSPEED: Unlike other sustains or supports Speed isn't an essential stat for Aventurine as he can achieve most of his goals without it - still it can be situationally powerful under the right circumstances. When playing Aventurine in teams with many Follow-Up attackers he'll gain substantially more Blind Bet stacks from their Follow-Up's but with a cap of 3 per one of his actions. In some teams for example ones that include Topaz that 3 Bet cap can easily be reached and exceeded if Aventurine isn't at least a comparable Speed to the follow-up attackers. If they're significantly faster than him they'll lap Aventurine wasting a portion of his kit - to avoid this grab some Speed. Speed also offers more skill points, ultimates, and opportunities for emergency shields in a pinch. DEF%: DEF% is Aventurine's best sustaining and damaging stat as it triple dips on stats he wants. It increases the base damage of all of his damage abilities, improves the total amount his shields can shield for, and also grants him a huge CRIT RATE boost stacking until he reaches 4000 DEF after which it caps. For these reasons stacking DEF single-mindedly is absolutely the correct thing to do up until you can reach 4000. At this point Aventurine should have more than enough shielding capabilities to keep the team alive in all content, has great base damage values on all of his attacks, and cannot gain more CRIT RATE from his bonus ability after which other stats shoot up the priority list. CRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: After reaching 4000 DEF, CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG become an enticing prospect for Aventurine allowing him to substantially boost his damage. As Aventurine gains so much CRIT RATE for free from his bonus ability CRIT DMG is the priority and should be stacked first to achieve a 1:2 CRIT / CRIT DMG ratio but after equalizing things they should be stacked in equal amounts to maximize your Aventurines damage.

This combo also has reasonable damage and is our top recommendation for general play if you have or are willing to farm it. Knight of Purity Palace + The Ashblazing Grand Duke / Pioneer Diver of Dead WatersA mix of DEF% from 2P Knight and damage from 2P Grand Duke or 2P Pioneer can yield the DEF Aventurine needs in order to reach the essential 4000 DEF breakpoint while also boosting his damage more than the purely defensive 4P Knight set. Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters + The Ashblazing Grand DukeSacrifices all DEF bonuses for a high and mostly unconditional damage boost which should only be considered if your Aventurine can reach 4000 defence without the help of the 2P Knight set. Ensure you can keep at least 1 debuff on all enemies to gain maximum effect from this combo. Pioneer Diver of Dead WatersA specialist set for Aventurine that can be used when his build and team are just right for a substantial personal damage boost. At a minimum when using this set you'll want at least 2 but ideally 3 debuffs on most targets to take advantage of the base level of the 4P set.Aventurine himself can apply debuffs with his ultimate, contributing to the debuffs needed and also activating the doubling effect of the 4P (but the uptime of this effect is quite limited). With Aventurine's Signature equipped, his Follow-Up attacks all apply debuffs making the doubling effect and debuff requirement of this set far far far more manageable and making this a top set compared to other Light Cones.Inert SalsottoBest damaging set for Aventurine, offering a noticeable jump in damage compared to other Planars without limiting his ability to easily hit 4000 DEF with most Cone options. Broken Keel Sacrifices Aventurine's maximum damage potential for the ability to grant the entire team 10% CRIT DMG. Best all-around option for most team compositions unless your Aventurine has exceptional investment, and as a result, damage output. Penacony, Land of Dreams Alternative team boosting set when Aventurine is supporting a pure Imaginary damage line-up while also granting him a small amount of Energy Recharge. Belobog of Architects Despite being a set that grants DEF%, a stat Aventurine loves, it loses in utility to supportive sets and in damage to Inert Salsotto. Only recommended for use with exceptional stats or to save stamina farming. Fleet of the Ageless Offers 0 benefit to Aventurine himself but can be used as a supportive set if no other options are present or with good sub-stats. "

            "formatted": "Aventurine is an extremely potent Preservation sustain character. He has tremendously powerful shielding available to him through both his Skill and Talent follow-up, and will grant a large amount of Effect RES to shielded allies. Having shielded allies attacked will charge his follow-up, and both the follow-up and direct Skill use will stack the shield effect up to 200%. Ally follow-up attacks will also charge his follow-up. All of Aventurine's damage scales off of DEF, and he gains a large amount of free CRIT Rate for building for DEF.Everyone's favourite gambling enthusiast and certified lucky boy is finally here for us to take home. Aventurine boasts arguably the best team survivability in the game while also contributing actually good amounts of damage. He's got good synergy with follow-up teams, and since he's got a debuff that he can apply with his Ultimate, he's got some intrinsic value for teams with Acheron or Ratio as well. His kit is a little wordy, but his game plan is extremely simple \u2014 a nice change of pace from many of the other Penacony characters.Aventurine's Skill will grant all allies a shield that can block up to 24% DEF plus 320, lasting for 3 turns. This shield is referred to as Fortified Wager, and this will be important for later. This Fortified Wager shield can be stacked on top of itself, meaning using it again will add the new shield on top of the old shield, providing even greater protection. This can be stacked up to 200% of the original shield value, and it updates dynamically in case your DEF value changes.This is the first instance of a shield being able to stack outside of the Simulated Universe, and it's just as powerful as it sounds. An AoE shield having the value Aventurine's does is already very good since it's easily applied through a single Skill use, but more ridiculous is that a fully stacked shield will be equal to 48% DEF plus 640 \u2014 a value higher than that of Gepard's Ultimate! Since it lasts for 3 turns and can be easily reapplied and stacked on top of itself, keeping the team alive is really rather easy.Aventurine's Talent also plays into this, turning the dial on his shield value from 'high' to 'immense'. While an ally has a Fortified Wager shield, they will gain up to 50% Effect RES, and whenever an ally with Fortified Wager is attacked, Aventurine will gain 1 point of Blind Bet, and when Aventurine himself is attacked with Fortified Wager, he will gain an additional point of Blind Bet on top. Blind Bet can stack up to 10 times, and will immediately launch a follow-up attack when it reaches 7 points, consuming 7 points in the process. This follow-up hits 7 times dealing up to 25% DEF per hit, and hits a single random enemy each time. Aventurine himself also gains a one-time Crowd Control immunity while he has Fortified Wager, and this effect has a 2 turn cooldown.This follow-up attack is actually quite strong, dealing a total damage of 175% DEF and an impressive 70 Toughness Damage, 10 per hit. Especially against low amounts of targets, Aventurine can quite quickly shred through their Toughness gauges. The free Effect RES for allies is also extremely potent and can greatly reduce the chances of anyone ever getting inflicted with a pesky Crowd Control debuff, but equally worth mentioning is that this Effect RES will also greatly help against various non Crowd Control debuffs as well, such as DEF downs or enemy DoT effects. The follow-up also regenerates 7 Energy at base, so Aventurine's energy economy is actually better than one might expect. The condition for gaining points of Blind Bet is extremely lenient as well, since all you need is to have any ally with Fortified Wager get hit, including himself.Aventurine's Ultimate will grant him a random number of Blind Bet points upon use, anywhere from 1 to 7. He then inflicts a single enemy with the Unnerved debuff for 3 turns. Unnerved enemies will receive up to 15% increased CRIT DMG. This is a rather nice increase to overall team damage, especially since it\u2019s coming from a sustain unit and not a dedicated support. This attack will deal up to 270% DEF, and since it's a single-target Ultimate, will also deal 90 Toughness damage.This is why his Blind Bet can stack up to 10, since using his Ultimate could consistently overcap you heavily otherwise. A 3 turn duration on such a powerful debuff is very uncommon, and it's no slouch in the damage department either. Together with his Talent's follow-up, he can deal 160 Toughness damage in quick succession to a single foe, decimating their Toughness bar. Surprisingly, his Ultimate only has a meagre cost of 110 Energy, meaning he can have it up quite frequently, especially considering he's likely to be getting hit more than the rest of the team due to being a Preservation unit. Factoring in his follow-up's Energy regeneration as well, and it's well within reason to have this debuff near permanently active on all but the absolute fastest foes.Up until this point you may have been thinking 'well, that's all great, but if I need to use SP to stay alive, why would I choose this guy over one of our other excellent sustains?', and the answer to that becomes apparent when you look at his Bonus Ability Traces. His A2 will provide a bonus to his CRIT Rate, 2% CRIT Rate for every 100 points of DEF that Aventurine has that exceeds 1600. He can gain a maximum increase of 48%, achieved at 4000 DEF. Achieving this value is actually quite easy, especially since you\u2019re likely to be building with DEF in mind. You get a significant bump to his personal damage while still maximising the strength of his shields.His A4 and A6 are what bump his team survivability up to extremely competitive levels. A4 will automatically grant every ally a Fortified Wager shield when entering combat, equal to 100% of the Skill's value for 3 turns. This sets up strong defences very early on at no cost. Continuing the trend, A6 will provide all allies a weaker Fortified Wager shield upon launching Aventurine's follow-up attack, blocking 7% DEF plus 96, and providing double the value to the ally with the lowest HP. Aventurine will now also get a point of Blind Bet every time an ally with Fortified Wager launches a follow-up attack, up to 3 times between Aventurine's turns.I should remind you now that all of Aventurine's Fortified Wager shields stack, meaning it is very easy to go for long stretches of time where Aventurine doesn't have to use his Skill whatsoever to keep allies from taking damage. This immediately raises his SP efficiency to be more similar to that of Fu Xuan, only occasionally needing to use his Skill before beefy AoE hits. If you don't need to do that, then Aventurine could very well even be fully SP positive, all while still providing his strong offensive utility and follow-up synergy, putting him firmly on par with the likes of Fu Xuan \u2014 potentially even stronger.It should be pretty clear now that Aventurine is one of the outright strongest sustains we've ever gotten. Free stacking shields with the potential for SP flexibility to adapt to situations, coupled with fantastic no-cost offensive utility and an Ultimate that debuffs an enemy into taking more damage from your CRIT DPS. This guy has no trouble going toe-to-toe with the nastiest foes we've got, and that's unlikely to ever change, especially given that actually playing him is the simplest thing in the world. Need shield? Skill. Don't need shield? Don't Skill. You'll get a shield soon either way.Aventurine really doesn't need his Eidolons, but I personally know at least one person who's going all-in for Best Boy\u2122, so best of luck to her and here's the breakdown. E1 will provide a passive 20% increase to CRIT DMG for allies with Fortified Wager, and will instantly provide a full strength Fortified Wager to all allies after using his Ultimate, and E2 will have Aventurine's Basic ATK reduce his target's All-Type RES by 12% for 3 turns. Both of these first two Eidolons have tremendous value should you choose to go for them, especially E2, but again they\u2019re not at all necessary. E4 will increase Aventurine's DEF by 40% after using his follow-up and will increase the Hits Per Action of his follow-up by 3, and E6 will grant Aventurine one of the most ridiculous DMG boosts in the game, 50% per shielded ally up to 150% maximum.Now, I should clarify that Aventurine actually does really good damage, especially for a sustain unit. It\u2019s not going to eclipse any actual DPS characters, but it's certainly enough to be noticeable and to have a meaningful impact on the overall combat result. To that end, I wouldn't really recommend going all-in on offensive main stat Relics. Going for DEF will improve both his shield strength and his damage, and he maxes out his A2 bonuses at the 4000 DEF mark. Beyond this any DEF will start to suffer from some diminishing returns, but more DEF is never bad. If you\u2019re really looking to optimise his damage, you can start searching for offensive stats beyond this point, but this only really starts to matter if you\u2019ve got his signature Light Cone.At the end of the day, Aventurine is a sustain unit, and no matter how good his damage may or may not be, he needs to be able keep your team alive first and foremost. If you are unable to do that because you botched his build to deal 200 more damage per hit, that\u2019s entirely on you. If you\u2019re looking to get that much more oomph from this party slot, you\u2019d probably be better going without a sustain unit at all, so just be careful falling into the trap of forgetting why he\u2019s on your team, especially if you don\u2019t have his signature Light Cone.Having said that, Aventurine's got great Light Cone choices so you shouldn't feel pressured into getting his signature unless you really want to reach the maximum damage possible. Without his signature, his damage will fall quite considerably though, so it may not be worth fully pursuing damage on him if you\u2019re not using at least a 5-star Light Cone. He's universally usable, and especially because he has the potential to be fully SP positive, you can really just slot him into any team and not have to worry about dying from that point on. He's even got some synergy for Acheron and Dr. Ratio since his Ultimate applies a debuff; it's not as good as what Gallagher provides to Acheron specifically, and is quite a ways below what the Preservation Trailblazer can provide with Trend of the Universal Market equipped, but Aventurine is also a Preservation unit and so can also utilise the synergy Trend provides, albeit at a far lesser rate than Fire MC.Aventurine is probably the best universal sustain in the game now, he\u2019s just got everything you could ask for and more, and especially when it comes to follow-up teams, this is where Aventurine completely blows away the competition. He\u2019s already very SP efficient and deals great damage and Toughness damage, but it\u2019s dialled up to 11 when paired with frequent follow-up attackers like Dr. Ratio and Topaz.Thanks to his A6, Aventurine gets so many points of Blind Bet that he\u2019s constantly dropping chips on his enemies at an expeditious rate, skyrocketing his Toughness damage to be the highest of any sustain unit in the game, even beating out Gallagher. The increased frequency of follow-ups also means he\u2019s constantly stacking and refreshing the Fortified Wager shield, making the team damn near invincible. Under the right planets-align circumstances, the amount of Toughness damage can actually be so high that it has the potential to eclipse pretty much every other character as well, though how often one gets to experience this depends on the exact team and the enemy lineup.While Aventurine does have specific synergies with follow-up characters, he's entirely self-sufficient and should not be regarded as only a sustain for these teams. Like I said before, he's universal, and anyone who says otherwise is... incorrect. The gambler knows what's what, and he's an excellent addition to any team. I would consider him to be quite possibly the best sustain unit we've gotten so far, so especially if you're a newer player or a meta-chaser, you should definitely look into acquiring this golden boy. He\u2019s going to be a staple of follow-up teams for a very long time.The only question that remains is how does he get such a crisp fingersnap while wearing gloves?"

            "formatted": "Bailu is a competent healing sustain unit on the Path of Abundance. She focuses on automatic reactive healing upon sustaining damage with her Ultimate, providing damage reduction and a maximum health increase for all allies. She is also in possession of a 1-time ally revive, immediately restoring them to life. She has consistent healing for both single-target and AoE, but she crucially has no way of cleansing debuffs at all, setting her apart from other Abundance characters.Despite popular opinion, Bailu is still a very decent healer. Similarly to Gepard, her value has ebbed and flowed over time, with now her method of healing being actually quite favourable against the powerful onslaught that enemies throw your way. She is by no means a standout healer, mostly because the competition in terms of sustain units is frighteningly high, but she'll carry your sorry butt through the end game no problem.Bailu's Talent is the focal point. Whenever an ally with Invigoration gets hit, their HP will immediately be restored by up to 5.4% of Bailu's Max HP plus 144, and this can trigger 2 times every time Invigoration is applied. This Invigoration buff comes from her Ultimate, but the healing values are dependent on her Talent levels. Her Talent also has a 1 time ally revive, being able to restore their HP by up to 18% of Bailu's Max HP plus 480 upon receiving a fatal blow.This Invigoration buff heals in a very peculiar way compared to other Abundance units, as it provides its healing immediately upon getting hit by an enemy attack. This means you can actually survive an enemy onslaught that would ordinarily completely kill you; if a Boss acts twice against a single character and deals 5000 damage across those two hits, and your character only has 4000 HP, the healing that occurs after the first hit will actually allow this character to survive with a sliver of health remaining, so while Bailu cannot prevent literal one shots from occurring, any faux-oneshots spread over a couple of actions can be largely mitigated.Bailu's Ultimate immediately heals all allies for up to 13.5% of Bailu's Max HP plus 360 and applies Invigoration to any allies that do not yet have it. Allies that already have Invigoration will have its duration extended by 1 turn. Invigoration lasts for 2 turns. This essentially means that regardless of anything else, using Bailu's Ultimate will guarantee that all allies have at least 2 turns of Invigoration.This Ultimate is actually pretty good as it only costs a measly 100 Energy while also being incredibly potent emergency healing, and this then of course translates to higher Invigoration uptime leading to greater and more consistent passive healing output.Bailu's Skill is not particularly noteworthy, as the healing from her Ultimate and Invigoration should be enough to cover the party's needs. She targets a single ally and heals them for up to 11.7% of Bailu's Max HP plpus 312. Then this heal will Bounce to a random ally 2 times, with each Bounce reducing the heal amount by 15%. This is somewhat unreliable as an AoE heal as it could very easily just heal the target ally 3 times in a row, or go to heal an ally that doesn't need it, but if you're really in dire straits, this can be an effective way to top off characters in need.Bailu's Bonus Traces further amplify her defensive utility. A2 allows any healing in excess of 100% of a character's Max HP to increase that ally's Max HP by 10% for 2 turns. A4 allows Invigoration to trigger an extra time, leading to 3 total activations between reapplications of Invigoration, and A6 will provide a 10% damage reduction to characters with Invigoration. A6 in particular is a vastly underestimated boost \u2014 damage reduction is pretty cracked, yo, and having it up permanently vastly reduces the amount of overall damage that comes your way, especially over the course of a single fight.As a standard character, you could very well get Eidolons for Bailu over time. While she's far from the best standard character to get Eidolons for, they still provide nice bonuses to an already competent unit. E1 has good value and will restore 8 Energy for a character if their HP is fully topped off when Invigoration ends. By no means game-changing but a nice boost.Bailu's days as the only other healer are long long behind us, and she has very steep competition as a sustain unit. Luocha was the first to run away with the crown, providing outstanding passive healing as well while also being effortless to maintain. Luocha also has a cleanse on his Skill and an AoE dispel on his Ultimate, and manages to be one of the absolute most SP-positive units in the game, still being used in the most meta teams to this day.Then came Fu Xuan and took the damage reduction niche to such an extreme that future sustain characters have their work cut out for them if they want to compete with that level of power. Not only that, but Fu Xuan outright prevents a single teamwide application of crowd control while also having damage redirection allowing her to circumvent true oneshots. Then Huohuo showed up and changed the game forever by being a Harmony and Abundance in one, while also having a ridiculous amount of passive healing and cleansing.Bailu doesn't have a cleanse. She doesn't increase CRIT rate, and doesn't increase ATK or give Energy. She is a healer and that is all that she is. Frankly she's been left behind, and the reasons to use her keep disappearing one by one as more and more people have access to stronger and newer sustain options. Not having a cleanse in this day and age of the game is just asking for trouble.Bailu is not bad as a standalone character, but any comparisons are very much not in her favour. The unfortunate reality is that this will continue to be the case, as future sustain units will continue upping the ante thanks to the ridiculousness of the sustain units that came before. If you do not have a competent second sustain unit, or want to replace Natasha as soon as possible, Bailu will do that for you. But the second you get a limited 5-star sustain, Bailu may well be warming that bench for the rest of her Vidyadhara life cycle.'The moment a healer with more utility gets released, Bailu will likely be superseded by them.' What a terrible day to have been correct."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - Effect Hit Rating >= ATK%Effect Hit Rating is recommended and in most cases required for almost every Black Swan build to reach a comfortable level of consistency. If you're able to hit 100-120% EHR without an EHR body ATK% body can be used instead.Feet - SpeedBest in Slot for Black Swan.Planar Sphere - ATK% = Wind DMGEither can be used - their performance is similar and which is better depends on your gear, team choice, and Light Cone,If you have many ATK% buffs from your team and Light Cone, Wind% Planar is best,If you have many DMG% buffs but few ATK% buffs, ATK% Planar is better.Link Rope - ATK%Best in Slot for Black Swan.Additional notes for sub-statsEffect Hit Rating: Most of Black Swan's abilities even at max trace level have a fairly low base chance to hit with the most important ones being 65% base chance at trace level 10 where most enemies in endgame have 20-40% Effect RES. Because of these points without Effect Hit Rating Black Swan is completely helpless to consistently apply her Arcana meaning it's all but mandatory in order to play her effectively. Most enemies in endgame have 30% Effect RES and in order to guarantee most of your abilities land (assuming your Black Swan's traces are at level 10) you'll need 120% Effect Hit Rating which conveniently is the cap of her bonus ability which grants additional DMG% per point of effect hit rating. All endgame Black Swan builds should aim for 120% Effect Hit Rating to ensure most of her abilities land and also gain the full 72% DMG% from her bonus ability, if you're struggling to reach 120%, 100% is acceptable while you're still gearing up.SPEED: Speed as on all characters is exceptionally powerful in endgame for Black Swan and shooting for as high a Speed breakpoint as possible is advised. In addition to the extra actions Speed provides moving faster than your opponent also grants Black Swan the opportunity to stack her DoT's just that much sooner allowing for larger initial Arcana activations at the beginning of every new wave. Focus on hitting a high breakpoint and if possible always ensuring Black Swan moves before the majority of enemies you're facing to ensure maximum damage."

This set DEF shred bonus is easy to activate in Swan's teams and stacks absurdly well with her own kit's defense shred dramatically boosting her damage.Other setsAll the other set combinations are simply inferior to the Prisoner one, but you can use them until you farm it.Pan-Cosmic Commercial EnterpriseBest in slot for Black Swan when building her with consistency and flexibility in mind. Black Swan requires a massive amount of effect hit rating to consistently apply her DoT's in endgame and the 10% Pan-Cosmic provides is a fantastic boost - as she builds well over 100% EHR she also fully unlocks this planar sets bonus of 25% ATK.Firmament Frontline: GlamothA top damaging option for Black Swan if you can acquire your required Effect Hit Rating from other sources. Endgame Black Swan builds build as much speed as possible with the minimum recommended endgame requirement being 134 which easily activates the damage bonus of this set. The second portion of the set bonus requiring 160 speed is also accessible given enough investment especially when paired with speed boosting supports and is absolutely realistic to aim for.Space Sealing StationA good easy-to-access planar set that isn't too far behind alternatives."

She has a stackable DoT effect that can spread itself to adjacent targets and deal ridiculous amounts of damage outside of her turn. With enough stacks, this DoT will also ignore a portion of the affected enemies\u2019 DEF. Black Swan can also further reduce enemy DEF with her Skill, and increase enemy vulnerability with her Ultimate, the latter providing greater opportunities to stack her powerful DoT further by preventing its falloff for one turn.At last, the mysterious figure we first saw in the Fables About the Stars is finally here. Look, I\u2019ll start by saying that this is one of the most complex dps characters we\u2019ve gotten thus far, so I will do my best to explain exactly how she works and why she\u2019s so terrifying. This is easily the longest review to date, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me for making you read this much.Black Swan\u2019s entire kit revolves around her Talent and its associated debuff called Arcana, and it\u2019s all rather verbose. Arcana is a debuff that deals Damage over Time (DoT) but it has a certain interaction I\u2019ll explain later. Just keep this in mind. Enemies afflicted by Arcana will receive Wind DoT at the start of their turn, up to 240% ATK. Each stack of Arcana increases this multiplier by 12%, meaning this starts to scale very quickly. Then, after the enemy receives the damage from Arcana, the Arcana stacks reset to 1. Arcana can stack up to 50 times. If you\u2019re interested to know how much a 50 stacked Arcana proc does, it\u2019s 840% ATK. That\u2019s an Argenti Ultimate. It\u2019s an Argenti Ultimate. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get to 50 outside of Simulated Universe or without her E6, but you can still get quite high stacks if you know what you\u2019re doing.Arcana gains stacks through multiple ways, including Black Swan\u2019s Skill and Basic ATK, but there is another part to her Talent first. Every time an enemy receives DoT at the start of their turn, there is a 65% base chance to apply another stack of Arcana. This includes all forms of DoT including Arcana itself. It doesn\u2019t look like it does because the damage happens so quickly but it actually does count itself before it applies the damage and resets to 1. This applies to other character\u2019s DoT effects, Light Cone DoT effects, and even Break DoT.So here\u2019s how it is; Arcana gains stacks whenever enemies receive DoT damage on their turn, with each stack adding onto the original damage multiplier. Arcana then deals its damage and resets its stacks to 1. Until you unlock a later Bonus Ability Trace, Arcana will only be stacked by Black Swan\u2019s Skill and Basic ATK, and by the enemy taking DoT damage on their turn. Arcana resetting to 1 after the enemy\u2019s turn also means that this is the first DoT effect that lasts indefinitely, so once it\u2019s been applied, that enemy is guaranteed to suffer.Aside from the increased multiplier, extra stacks gain bonus effects at certain milestones; at 3 Arcana stacks, the expiration of Arcana will additionally deal 180% ATK to adjacent targets with a 65% base chance of applying 1 stack of Arcana to said adjacent targets. This is how Arcana can spread stacks to other foes. This is also the first DoT effect in the game that can hit more than one enemy at a time, and it\u2019s a part of how Black Swan\u2019s AoE damage reaches highly competitive amounts.At 7 stacks of Arcana, the current DoT will ignore 20% of the main target\u2019s as well as adjacent foes\u2019 DEF, leading to even more ridiculous damage spikes. A well-formed team including at least one other DoT character will generally have no issues reaching this amount on tougher foes, but if you\u2019re ever using Black Swan by herself, you may find it happening less frequently.Okay that\u2019s the Talent, whew. Black Swan\u2019s Skill deals up to 90% ATK to a single enemy and adjacent foes. It also has a 100% base chance to apply 1 stack of Arcana to all targets hit. There is also a 100% base chance to reduce the DEF of targets hit by up to 20.8% for 3 whole turns. That\u2019s a lot for only one Skill. As a Blast AoE it also deals increased Toughness damage against the main target. This Skill is an easy way to start the Arcana stacking. The DEF Shred is also incredibly powerful, especially since DoT characters have such easy access to DEF ignore with the Prisoner in Deep Confinement Relic Set. This is your daily reminder that DEF Shred only gets better the more of it you have.Black Swan\u2019s Basic ATK is quite unique as it is one of the only non Enhanced Basic ATKs to have additional functionality. It deals up to 60% ATK to a single target and has a 65% base chance of applying 1 stack of Arcana to the attacked enemy. This means Swan can stack Arcana without even consuming SP in single-target scenarios, making her quite SP-positive in between reapplying the DEF Shred from her Skill.In addition to this, Swan\u2019s Basic ATK also has the following effect: if the attacked enemy is suffering from Wind Shear, Bleed, Burn, or Shock, then there is a 65% base chance of applying 1 extra stack of Arcana for each type of DoT debuff on the target. This allows Swan to tactically use her Basic ATK on specific enemies to add a large number of Arcana stacks in a single action without expending a single Skill Point, potentially landing her an extra 5 stacks. But it\u2019s probably unlikely to have that many DoT effects on an enemy\u2026 Unless\u2026Finally, we arrive at the Ultimate. This ability visually is just wild, and its effects are similarly insane. Black Swan\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 120% ATK to all enemies on the field and applies a debuff called Epiphany for 2 turns. Epiphany increases enemy DMG taken by 25% during their turn specifically, and additionally makes Arcana count as Wind Shear, Bleed, Burn, and Shock effects. Enemies afflicted by Epiphany will also not automatically reset the stacks of Arcana on their turn, and this non-reset effect can happen 1 time between reapplications.Now of course, upon reading this you may think that the 1 time non-reset for Arcana is the big draw \u2014 and you\u2019re right \u2014 but this line about Arcana counting as all four DoT effects simultaneously means a couple of things; firstly is that now any DoT teammates with forced DoT procs can now detonate Arcana with their own abilities; and secondly, Black Swan can now turbo stack Arcana by herself with her Basic ATK.With her Ultimate, Swan doesn\u2019t need the other DoT effects to actually be applied in order to make use of the extra functionality on her Basic ATK. It actually makes it very easy to get 2 uses out of a 7+ stacked Arcana with the full DEF ignore effect. The real issue is actually having enemies live long enough to make use of it \u2014 if enemies die before Arcana can trigger, it will not propagate, even if you have the required number of stacks. With her Ultimate only having a cost of 120 Energy, it\u2019ll actually be up fairly frequently, especially if Swan is the one getting the killing blows.Black Swan\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces heavily benefit her gameplay. Her A6 is of the same vein as Xueyi\u2019s A2, only for Effect Hit Rate instead of Break Effect; Black Swan gets bonus permanent DMG% based on how much Effect Hit Rate (EHR) she has, transferring 60% of EHR into DMG%, up to a cap of 72%. This means Black Swan will have this maximum bonus at 120% EHR. That\u2019s a lot of EHR, but given Swan\u2019s low base chances for Arcana, this actually helps reimburse the damage you lose from not having as much ATK as you normally would for a DoT unit.A2 gives Black Swan\u2019s Skill the same additional functionality that her Basic ATK has, namely the ability to proc extra stacks of Arcana on enemies with any of the four standard DoT effects, meaning her Skill can now also turbo stack Arcana during her Ultimate\u2019s Epiphany effect, as well as benefiting from any DoT effects from allies. The other big benefit of this is that the Skill is of course a Blast AoE meaning it\u2019s much easier to stack in AoE content, and using her Skill means more Energy back than a Basic ATK, leading to further increased Ultimate uptime. Do note that the extra stacking will only work against the primary target of the Blast AoE.A4 also helps rack up Arcana stacks through ally forced DoT detonations, having a 65% base chance of stacking 1 Arcana up to 3 times in a single attack. Anything that forces Arcana to proc will also count for this limit, but it does not specifically need to be Arcana that is detonated. This is beneficial for pretty much all other DoT units, such as Kafka, Sampo, Guinaifen, and even Luka.You don\u2019t need her Eidolons, they\u2019re redundant. There\u2019s already nothing that can endure Black Swan\u2019s damage, who are you trying to kill here? God? Well with her Eidolons you may very well be able to do that, just like in a classic JRPG. Actually maybe she can already do that\u2026 Insert Trailblazer speech about choices here.Okay that\u2019s the kit broken down, and it\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s actually not too bad once you\u2019ve tinkered with it a little. All you\u2019re doing is stacking Arcana as much as you can and using the Ultimate to facilitate this when possible. Ideally you\u2019re getting 7 or more stacks before the enemy\u2019s turn, but as long as you\u2019re getting enough for the number of enemies you\u2019re fighting, you\u2019ll be just fine. It\u2019s definitely easier said than done, however. Pairing Black Swan with at least one other DoT teammate will expedite the stacking of Arcana.Kafka is of course the first one to come to mind, and it should surprise nobody to hear that she is Black Swan\u2019s best teammate. Kafka being able to detonate DoT effects with both her Skill and her Ultimate mean that stacking Arcana is really not very challenging at all, and that\u2019s just at base; if your Kafka has her signature Light Cone, that counts as an extra DoT for the purposes of Black Swan\u2019s A4, so it\u2019s even better but by no means a necessity. They both work extremely well with each other and due to the ease of access of DEF Shred and DEF ignore for both DoT units and Nihility units, coupled with Black Swan\u2019s inherent DEF ignore, this makes for an extremely powerful team that has no trouble killing pretty much everything in the game.As a pair for Kafka, Black Swan is going to be compared to everyone\u2019s favourite Sampo Koski due to them both being Wind Nihility DoT units. I am a big Sampo shill, you\u2019ll know this if you read his review. He has exactly two things going for him, and that is superior Breaking and vastly superior ease of use. That\u2019s it. In all other aspects, Black Swan absolutely trounces Sampo. You know it\u2019s true when I\u2019m telling you this. Sampo is still more than capable in his own right and the bar he sets is already fairly high\u2026 Black Swan is just better.\u00a0She does work pretty well in a team with Sampo though, especially if Sampo is at or above E4. In single-target scenarios, Sampo plus Swan is actually somewhat competitive with Kafka plus Swan, though this starts to fall behind the latter in AoE scenarios. Sampo is also a lot easier to pick up and play, and has superior Breaking, so there are still cases where you may want to use him. Just please remember that both Sampo and Swan need a minimum ramp-up time in combat, even if Swan can lead with 1 stack of Arcana.It should be noted that Black Swan does not technically need DoT teammates to deal damage, but by omitting another DoT unit from the team, Black Swan cares far more about her Ultimate and its uptime, meaning you will need to facilitate as much Energy for her as possible if you choose to go this route. Hear this, it is generally not worth it to use Swan as a hypercarry \u2014 not necessarily\u00a0 because she\u2019s bad at it, but because it just wholly squanders her potential. Just use her properly, it\u2019s ironically less of a headache.Black Swan is also usable as a damage-support hybrid due to the DEF Shred on her Skill. It\u2019s not really the recommended way of using her but you definitely can do that, I guess. Nihility is a path that doesn\u2019t care about rules anyway, so you can always just slap on Resolution Shines as Pearls of Sweat and have even more DEF reduction on your Black Swan, or just go the standard damage route and make up the difference that way. While she doesn\u2019t have quite as much damage amplification as other supports, she does have formidable personal damage, so\u2026 do with this information what you will. This playstyle can become even more potent with her E1, but it is not necessary for her to be used in this way.Keep in mind that if you want to bring the absolute most out of Black Swan, you should be playing her in a DoT team with other DoT characters. Swan at her max is overkill, but if you truly want to min-max, this is the way you reach that height. Comparing her support hybrid playstyle to the DoT team playstyle is like comparing gold to platinum; they\u2019re both amazing, but one is still notably more coveted.This brings us to a few caveats and one \u2018downside\u2019 that Black Swan has. The downside in question is not really a downside, it\u2019s that Black Swan deals too much damage. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of amusing but she actually does so much damage that there\u2019s almost nothing in the game at present that survives long enough for Swan to make full use of her kit. This of course means that Black Swan isn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon; she\u2019s likely to remain strong and useful for a very long time. Hardly a downside in terms of actual character strength, but certainly something that can impact the player\u2019s fun if all it takes is Black Swan sighing at the enemies to turn them to dust against more than one enemy.The first real issue is that Black Swan takes the crown away from Xueyi for \u2018most ridiculous investment floor requirement\u2019. With all of Swan\u2019s important Arcana related effects being stuck at a 65% base chance to occur, you are going to need an exorbitant amount of Effect Hit Rate, upwards of 120%. Due to the importance and power of Arcana stacks, as well as Black Swan\u2019s A6 giving DMG% for EHR, you are highly incentivised to go for this.You want all of this plus the usual affair for DoT characters of high SPD and high ATK. Her signature Light Cone alleviates this investment requirement, but she doesn't need her signature Light Cone in any way, and she is evaluated as if she does not have it. Even if it is complete overkill \u2014 and it is\u2014, it may be something you consider going for to even further bolster this character for the future. Luckily for us all, Nihility Light Cones are just built different, and you are not lacking for good and even competitive accessible choices. All you\u2019ll need to do is factor in the stats you\u2019re missing and go from there.The second issue is that Black Swan is a complex character. If you\u2019ve made it this far in the review, I shouldn\u2019t really need to tell you this, but it does highlight that making the most out of Black Swan relies on you having a very clear understanding of what everything in her kit does and how it interacts with other things, because it could be the difference between a big brain play that wipes the field, or a small brain play that leaves the enemy alive and very angry. This is the \u2018Skill issue\u2019 issue, but it\u2019s honestly not too difficult to overcome by just playing Swan; sometimes you may need to hold her Ultimate to hit a fresh wave or to turbo stack Arcana on Elites or Bosses, and sometimes you may need to change your primary target to better propagate Arcana. You will naturally get a feel for how she works over time.Black Swan is a pretty devastating character, to say the least. Her kit is intricate and requires a lot of investment, but she is undeniably one of the absolute strongest units in the game, across multiple roles. She divines the fate of her foes, and that fate is death. Such is the reward for learning the ways of the mysterious Black Swan."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "\u2018Local man literally too angry to die\u2019 is an apt description for this Stellaron Hunter. Blade is an astonishingly durable and hard-hitting damage dealer. As a berserker-style character, he consumes his own HP to deal massive damage against both lone foes as well as groups of enemies and is able to recover that HP on his own terms, creating a very self-sufficient loop to decimate all his adversaries.Particularly important to note right off the bat, Blade scales with his HP in addition to his ATK, in fact, his HP scaling is notably better than his ATK scaling to the point where it\u2019s better to focus on HP over ATK. This has the rather powerful and rare result of vastly improving his damage output as well as his survivability, gaining HP values far exceeding those of any other character.\u00a0Blade\u2019s gameplay revolves heavily around his Talent. Whenever Blade sustains damage or consumes his own HP, he gains 1 stack on his Talent, up to a max of 5, and he can only get 1 stack from every individual attack against him (so no multi-hit shenanigans). At 5 stacks, Blade immediately launches a follow-up attack on all enemies, consuming all stacks and dealing up to 40% of his ATK plus 110% of his Max HP at max Trace level. In addition to this he also heals 25% of his Max HP at all levels. It is important to mention that any of his own attacks that consume HP cannot reduce him below 1 HP, and if his HP is insufficient then it\u2019ll just get set to 1 HP and the action will continue.This Talent makes it so that Blade does not care too much about being attacked, in fact, he may actually enjoy it. Having a follow-up on a Destruction character is uncommon, but especially with the way it works, getting to attack out of turn is already phenomenal, but having that huge of a heal, in addition, is the cherry on top. Considering his Skill and Ultimate interface with Blade\u2019s HP as well, it\u2019s very easy to rack up stacks on his Talent without needing to rely on getting hit.His Skill consumes 30% of his Max HP to enter the Hellscape state for 3 turns, and grants him an Extra Action upon use. Interestingly because of the Extra Action, the 3 turn Hellscape state technically lasts for 4 turns, so it\u2019s really quite efficient. While under Hellscape, Blade cannot use his Skill again, but his Basic ATK is Enhanced to become a Blast AoE, dealing up to 40% of his ATK plus 100% of his Max HP against the primary target and dealing 16% of his ATK plus 40% of his Max HP against adjacent foes. Using this Enhanced Basic also consumes 10% of his Max HP.\u00a0This Enhanced Basic cannot generate Skill Points, but it also doesn\u2019t consume any extra SP, meaning only the initial cost of the Skill is factored in. Despite this, this particular Enhanced Basic actually restores 30 Energy meaning it restores more Energy than you would otherwise expect. The additional Toughness damage is also very appreciated and allows Blade to have a much easier time breaking enemies in both single target and AoE. Every instance of HP consumption from this, meaning the initial Skill use and any subsequent Enhanced Basics, also adds to the stacks on his Talent.\u00a0The HP consumption from his Skill is steep, but since all of it contributes stacks to his Talent, it\u2019s not unreasonable to heal most of that HP back without any enemy interference. You may notice that it\u2019s not actually enough HP recovery to offset the full cost of the Skill and its 3 Enhanced Basics, but that\u2019s where his Ultimate comes in.Blade\u2019s Ultimate sets his current HP to be 50% of his Max HP and does a Blast AoE against the targeted foe, dealing up to 40% of his ATK plus 100% of his Max HP at max Trace level, with adjacent foes taking 16% ATK plus 40% Max HP. This then deals additional damage based on the amount of HP Blade has lost in the current battle, capping out at 90% of his Max HP. This value is stored and dealt to the enemy upon using his Ultimate, 100% of the stored value going to the main target and 40% to adjacent foes. This value then resets and starts counting again until his next Ultimate, repeating again.Setting Blade\u2019s HP value to be 50% of his Max HP means that if you\u2019re below that amount then you\u2019ll heal, but if you\u2019re above it then you will consume HP. There is an opportunity cost present here where it can either be used as potentially a massive self-heal to get back to a reasonable HP value, or it can be used at higher HP values to add an extra stack to his Talent. Typically this is likely to be used primarily as a method of healing, since Blade already deals plenty of damage on his own, but with the huge Energy cost of 130, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to gauge whether or not you want to try and optimise his damage a little further.Blade is not particularly reliant on his Ultimate to deal damage, as the brunt of the work is done by his Talent and Hellscape, but with the improved Energy generation Blade has from his Enhanced Basics and his Talent\u2019s follow-up attack, he\u2019ll have it up quite often. If Blade is not paired with a suitably powerful healer like Luocha or Bailu, his Ult is probably best used for healing himself. While it is in no way necessary to pair Blade with either of the above, they do allow him to throw caution almost entirely to the wayside, with Luocha especially turning Blade truly immortal in addition to the rest of the team.\u00a0Do know that Blade can absolutely still be killed. He is not invincible with zero effort unless backed by the aforementioned healers, and even then you should always pay attention. Blade absolutely does not need any outside help to be unkillable, but it certainly does lessen the burden of the player to play him well enough to reach that state, and without that safety net, Blade can actually be nightmarishly difficult to optimise for the average player. His playstyle is inherently risky and difficult, regardless of how much his kit tries to alleviate said risk.Blade\u2019s Major Traces help him to continue the carnage without losing too much momentum. A2 grants an Incoming Healing boost of 20% whenever he is below 50% Max HP, and A4 lets him restore 5% of his Max HP plus 100 whenever his Enhanced Basic hits a Weakness Broken enemy. At A6, Blade gets a significant damage increase by having a 20% DMG boost added to his Talent follow-up attack. His Minor Traces are also worth mentioning, since he gets a collective 12% CRIT Rate from them, making him have an easier time meeting CRIT requirements.His Eidolons are all very useful albeit entirely unnecessary for him to excel. In particular, E2 granting him 15% increased CRIT Rate under Hellscape is very potent, and if one is so inclined to chase it, his E6 reduces the number of stacks needed to proc his Talent from 5 to 4 as well as adding an extra 50% Max HP multiplier to the follow-up attack, dramatically increasing his overall survivability and damage. It is complete overkill.Because of Blade\u2019s unique interactions and scalings, he actually does not really benefit at all from Harmony characters like Tingyun or Yukong; Tingyun really doesn\u2019t do much of anything for him, and while Yukong\u2019s insane CRIT buffs are fantastic, they\u2019re far too infrequent on their own to be of much use to Blade.He likes SPD, and he likes to act frequently, and as such his optimal pairing is with Bronya. She does everything Blade wants, and with Blade\u2019s very low SP consumption, Bronya can afford to consistently use her Skill on Blade every single turn, boosting his damage output tremendously, albeit requiring some team SPD tuning beforehand. Asta is a much lesser but still viable alternative, providing a massive overall SPD buff through her Ultimate, even though her Talent\u2019s ATK buff is almost entirely wasted.\u00a0Nihility characters and other debuffers can also help boost Blade\u2019s damage significantly since they can simply increase the enemy\u2019s vulnerability to damage. Characters like Silver Wolf and Pela in particular are great pairings as well\u2014even Welt could work well, again because of the low SP consumption of Blade allowing Welt to also contribute meaningful damage even on a support build. Blade can even be used as a flex pick for certain teams, though his efficacy in those scenarios depends largely on the discretion of the individual player.Blade is a remarkable unit that seems poised to stay relevant for an exceptionally long time. With how durable of a damage dealer he is, even if future units come out that outdamage him, Blade\u2019s hallmark will remain his excellent survivability and ease of use in the end game.He\u2019s also in desperate need of a hug."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - GOOD SUBS > CRIT RATE > CRIT DMG > ATK Boothill has very little scaling potential from traditional damaging stats such as CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG, and ATK% and instead is more interested in high Break Effect and Speed. While damaging main stats aren't useless and can certainly contribute to some damage increases for him you'd much prefer to have outstanding sub-stat rolls of what he's truly after. As a general rule aim for a piece with a good Break and or Speed first and if you can get it on a damage-focused main stat treat it as a bonus. Feet - SpeedBest in Slot.Planar Sphere - GOOD SUBS > Phys DMG% > ATK%Similar to Boothill's body armor while PHYS DMG% is most optimal with ATK% being a close second, sub-stats should be the priority,Link Rope - Break Effect%Best in Slot.Additional notes for sub-statsAs mentioned throughout his build, Boothill is not a traditional damage dealer with almost all of his damage (80-90%) stemming from the Physical Break which does not scale off ATK%, is not affected by DMG%, and cannot critically strike. This means that pretty much ALL standard scaling options are off the table for Boothill with the exception of, of course, Break Effect % and Speed. You can still increase the 10-20% of Boothill's damage that isn't Break but compared to other characters that gain benefit to 100% of their damage the value is lacking making it more of a small bonus that you can pick up after maximizing his break damage Break Effect: Thanks to the majority of Boothill's damage being considered Break he of course can make excellent use of Break Effect% and wants as much as he can possibly get. Outside of Speed, Break Effect is the only accessible stat on Cone and Relics Boothill really has to pursue so don't be stingy when targetting it even at the cost of all other damage sub-stats you might be used to. Speed: Speed is the other stat Boothill can scale to deal more damage but with the added benefit of allowing him to attack more frequently remedying one of the flaws of his kit his pure single-target nature. Speed isn't as unconditionally good as Break Effect though, it won't make his numbers any bigger, and outside of specific Speed breakpoints won't meaningfully increase his damage. Because of this, it's always a good idea to aim for a Speed breakpoint to ensure you're not just short of a big damage increase or overstacking it without much benefit.Additional notes for Speed breakpoints145 Speed: Activates Talia Kingdom of Banditry,160 Speed: Important cycle-based breakpoint,200 Speed: Highest realistically obtainable Speed breakpoint for cycle-based game modes.

Bronya when Speed-tuned to be slightly slower than Boothill (at least 1 Speed slower) can double his actions in combat addressing the aforementioned flaws and also tremendously boost his damage by literally double in most cases. Running Bronya traditionally requires some sacrifices to character rotations in order to make the team skill points work, but when run with Boothill that's less of an issue thanks to his empowered Basic Attack not consuming skill points. Unless you're rapid-fire slaying enemies and refreshing his Standoff every action, Bronya makes for an incredible teammate for Boothill with her only downside being that due to her high Skill Point consumption, she limits the use of other powerful supports such as Harmony MC."

Ruan Mei's benefits for Boothill don't stop there though, her 50% Break Efficiency allows Boothill to start triggering his bonus Physical Breaks much sooner and consistently, and of course, stacks multiplicatively with his Talent, yielding by far the biggest Toughness damage hits in the game. Finally, Ruan Mei grants a bit of extra Ice break damage when Boothill nails a break bar but also Ruan's delay will allow Boothill's Physical Break Bleeds to trigger far more frequently - once when the enemy moves and then another after they recover from the delay shortly after."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Boothill is an extremely strong and self-sufficient single-target decimator. He is an entirely Break-focused character specializing in dealing extreme amounts of Toughness damage and subsequently exploding Broken enemies with raw Break DMG. He ramps up quickly and stays ramped up. In the event that an enemy is not weak to Physical, Boothill's Ultimate has a guaranteed Weakness Implant on it, allowing him to brute force his way through any enemy that does not lock their own Toughness bar. He is very versatile and effective.This Space Cowboy Galaxy Ranger showed up out of nowhere and turned out to be surprisingly endearing. Turns out he\u2019s also a very powerful DPS character. He is our first real Break DPS character, requiring completely different stats to our usual CRIT hypercarries. He's got a very complete and self-contained kit, and he's got no trouble showing any son of a nice lady the Boot.Boothill's Skill forces him and a single enemy to have a Standoff for 2 of Boothill's turns. Both units are Taunted and may not attack any other unit. During Standoff, Boothill receives 15% more DMG from the Taunted enemy, and the Taunted enemy receives up to 30% more DMG from Boothill. If Boothill Breaks the target or defeats them, he gets a stack of Pocket Trickshot, and Standoff will end. If he kills and Breaks in a single action, he will gain 2 stacks. Boothill can circumvent the Taunt with his Ultimate, letting him prime a new enemy in advance while he finishes off his current one, but that\u2019s a little farther down.Using the Skill gives no Energy, but it doesn't end his turn, much the same way that Qingque's Skill doesn't end her turn, essentially being an Extra Action. While Boothill is in Standoff, his Basic ATK gets Enhanced, dealing up to 220% ATK to a single enemy. This Enhanced Basic ATK actually restores 30 Energy and deals 60 Toughness damage as though it were a Skill. It's important to note that the Enhanced Basic costs no SP whatsoever, so Boothill is actually more SP efficient than most DPS characters. This is somewhat nullified if Boothill wins his Standoff in a single Action, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re slaying out.Boothill's Talent is the centrepiece of his Break kit. It gives him bonuses for having stacks of Pocket Trickshot granted from his Skill. Each stack will increase the Toughness damage of the Enhanced Basic ATK by 50%, for a max of 150% at 3 stacks. This results in the Enhanced Basic ATK dealing a total of 150 Toughness damage, the same as Argenti's level 2 Ultimate! If I had a nickel for every time a new character dealt 150 Toughness damage, I'd have two nickels. Not a lot, but weird it happened twice back to back (Harmony Trailblazer). There is technically a cap on how high the Toughness damage can go for this attack, but it looks so astronomically high that I don\u2019t think this is something we need to worry about any time soon.This results in Boothill very quickly deleting enemy Toughness bars and leaving them wondering what just happened. Ordinarily, this wouldn't do much on its own, but his Talent has a second part. If the target is Weakness Broken when you use the Enhanced Basic, Boothill pulls out his gosh darn ALL AMERICAN* FINGER GUNS to blow the enemy sky high, dealing an instance of Break DMG to the enemy based on the number of stacks of Pocket Trickshot. Per 1/2/3 stacks, he can deal up to 70%/120%/170% of Boothill's Physical Break DMG.Aside from looking incredible, this is pure Break DMG, meaning it only cares about the usual things that Breaking an enemy would; the level of the enemy, the Break Effect of Boothill, the maximum Toughness of the enemy, and any DEF or RES altering statuses. This means Boothill circumvents the downside of Break units, being able to continue to deal remarkable Break DMG even after the enemy has already been Broken, and up to 170% of his Break DMG on every single turn.Because the condition for this pure Break DMG to be dealt is to be using his Enhanced Basic when an enemy is Weakness Broken, Boothill will pull his finger guns on an non-Broken enemy as long as they're Broken during this Action, even if it's only on the very last hit; this Break DMG can also be in addition to the Break DMG you would deal by Breaking the enemy, resulting in an absolutely ludicrous amount of damage in a single action, and that's even before factoring the devastating Bleed Break DoT that comes after.Of course, the other disadvantage pure Break characters have is that if enemies aren't weak to their chosen element, you kinda can't do anything. Here's the thing though, Boothill's Talent lets him deal Break DMG to Broken enemies. Doesn't specify anywhere that they have to still be weak to Physical. It's completely reasonable to have enemies get Broken by allies and then to roll up like 'g'day mate' and blow their br \u2014 I mean uh, give them a goodnight kiss from the galactic homie (it's for the forever sleep he's sending them to).If you're still worried about that, enter Boothill's Ultimate. He will apply a Physical Weakness to a single enemy for 2 turns, and deal up to 400% ATK as damage. Additionally, he will delay their next action by up to 40%. Hey, look at that! He just gets to point at someone and say 'you are already Physical Weak', circumventing the only other big issue Break DPS have. It really is pointing and appointing the Weakness \u2014 this is a guaranteed Weakness Implant, there is absolutely no dice rolling or Effect Hit Rate requirement, it just does the thing. The delay is also incredible since it can also be used to extend the length of time an enemy stays Broken, giving him even longer to fill their dark soul with light\u2122.With this, Boothill can very realistically contend with any enemy in the game that does not lock their Toughness bar (think Gatekeeper Aurumaton). Sure, against non-Physical Weak enemies, Boothill's success will depend on his Ultimate uptime, but guess what, he gets a lot of Energy, and his Ultimate only costs 115 Energy. If your Boothill is particularly fast, it's very reasonable to expect that you can keep the Ultimate's Weakness Implant up pretty much 100% of the time on a major enemy. The only enemies fast enough to potentially outpace this (at least as of the time of writing) are naturally weak to Physical anyway.His Technique actually also lets him apply a Physical Weakness to enemies upon entering combat. The first enemy he uses his Skill on to initiate Standoff with will have the same Physical Weakness applied to them as the one from the Ultimate, lasting for 2 turns as well. This can let him ramp up right from the beginning when he doesn't have his Ultimate yet, even against enemies not weak to Physical.This man rocks, but it gets better with his Bonus Abilities. His A2 gives him increased CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG based on his Break Effect; 10% is converted to CRIT Rate and 50% is converted to CRIT DMG, for a maximum increase of 30%/150% of each, respectively, attainable at a maximum Break Effect of 300%. This also updates dynamically, so you can achieve this through external buffs during combat.The other two Bonus Abilities are very good, but this one is just exceptional levels of bait for those who are prone to stop reading after the first few lines.Boothill does indeed have ATK multipliers, and they can indeed deal damage, especially if they crit. However, consider the following: everything in this kit is screaming at you to build him full Break and not care about the rest. It's literally giving you a free pass to ignore the usually exorbitant build requirements that CRIT DPS have to go through to even start dealing damage. This Bonus Ability gives you a nice bonus for specifically building into one of the only two stats Boothill actually cares about, and lets him deal better damage while he's still whittling down an enemy's Toughness bar. It is NOT a free pass to build him as a CRIT DPS, and if you try to do this, then really what happens next is your own fault.His A4 makes it so that when Boothill is in Standoff with a target enemy, he will have 30% DMG Reduction against all other enemies not in Standoff with him, giving him a wonderful amount of survivability. Especially since he's got a lot of ways to stop his target from acting against him, everyone else he's not currently got in his sights will be dealing significantly less damage to him. Especially if you go for defensive stats on the Chest and Planar Sphere, you may be surprised to see that this cyborg is actually as tanky as his appearance should imply.Finally, his A6 is what really solves his Energy problems. While in Standoff, whenever he gains a stack of Pocket Trickshot he will also gain 10 Energy. This happens even if you're already capped, so you can very quickly and easily regain a large sum of Energy for just doing what you were already going to be doing, and this contributes to his Ultimate uptime. Without this particular Bonus Ability, Boothill can often be left at very awkward amounts of Energy, either barely not enough to Ult, or overcapping by more than you're comfortable with. This Trace solves that.Eidolons are never necessary for limited 5-stars, but for those interested, his Eidolons are pretty good. E1 will grant him a stack of Pocket Trickshot right at the start of combat, and all DMG Boothill deals will ignore 16% of targets' DEF. E2 refunds a Skill Point whenever he obtains Pocket Trickshot and grants 30% BE for 2 turns (this also works when overcapping but you can only trigger this once per turn). E4 gives enemies in Standoff a DMG Vulnerability of 12% when attacked by Boothill, and Boothill himself only takes 3% more DMG instead of 15% from the duelled target. Finally, E6 will let his Talent Break DMG deal an additional instance of Break DMG equal to 40% of the original amount, and also lets 70% of the original damage splash to adjacent targets, turning his finger guns finisher into Blast AoE.As mentioned earlier, Boothill only cares about two stats, the first being Break Effect, and the second being SPD. All that matters is getting his Break DMG as sky-high as you can and being fast enough to expedite the loop of Breaking and shooting fools. Because of this, you really don't need to care about stats like CRIT or ATK since they're not relevant to increasing his damage, and this makes Boothill quite a bit easier to build overall, especially since it lets you utilise previously doomed mainstat Chest and Planar Sphere pieces that have DEF%.This does come with an interesting new issue though: what Light Cone do I even use? As a Hunt character, the currently available Light Cone options are unsurprisingly tailored towards CRIT DPS like Seele and Dr. Ratio, which for a Break-focused character like Boothill\u2026 Not terribly useful. The only Hunt Light Cone that's tailored for Break is unsurprisingly Boothill's signature, so what should free-to-play players do?The solutions are either River Flows in Spring, the 4-star fully free Light Cone, or Adversarial. Yes, the 3-star Light Cone. Yes, really. Defeating an enemy gives you up to 18% SPD for 2 turns. You don't need to care about the low base ATK because it's not relevant for the damage he deals. The base HP and base DEF definitely do hurt, but you can mitigate this with defensive stats on Relics. River Flows in Spring is also good for a more consistent 12% SPD boost at S5, and has better defensive base stats than Adversarial.These are astonishingly good choices for casual players, but their conditions are quite steep. I wouldn't advise just anyone to try to make these work because it can lead to quite a frustrating experience; Adversarial stops working against big Bosses or Elites that don't summon adds to kill, and River Flows in Spring stops functioning for 2 turns if you take DMG. Of these two, River Flows in Spring is a clear winner if you're using Boothill alongside a Shielder like Aventurine, since the criteria for voiding the passive is specifically taking DMG; you can get hit so long as it doesn't go through the shield. It's unlikely you\u2019ll be using Aventurine here, since Gallagher is pretty much the best-in-slot sustain character for Boothill, but it is an option.Since the Herta Hunt Light Cone, Cruising in the Stellar Sea, is omnipresent and in extremely high demand for a lot of Hunt DPS, it's quite likely that if you've been playing for even a small amount of time, you'll already have units who are contesting this free 5-star Light Cone. Having said that, if nobody else needs it, Cruising provides the most consistent baseline performance, and is a very good option for players not going for Boothill's signature Light Cone. This is especially true for players who do not wish to gamble on the inconsistency of the alternative free options, however good they may be.In terms of teammates, Boothill actually has a lot of options because of his self-contained kit, but there are unsurprising victors when it comes to his best choices. Bronya in particular is a great support for him because more Actions for Boothill significantly increases his damage output, and will also facilitate his absurd Toughness damage to get enemies primed for maximum damage more quickly. Ruan Mei also achieves a similar effect through her Weakness Break Efficiency, albeit at slightly less overall impact, since Ruan Mei's SPD boost is far lower than the effective SPD Bronya can provide with her 100% Action Advance, and two turns of 150 Toughness each is more than a single turn of 225. Bronya is more SP intensive but Boothill's natural SP efficiency can counteract that.Neither of the generic DMG or CRIT buffs these supports provide meaningfully impact Boothill's damage output, and it is their secondary effects that make them extremely worth taking. One support who does significantly impact Boothill's damage while also contributing their own is the recently attained Harmony Trailblazer. The Break Effect they provide directly increases the DMG Boothill's Talent deals, and the Super Break the Trailblazer's Ultimate provides will let Boothill decimate his foes even more quickly. It doesn't necessarily make the process of Breaking enemies any easier like with Bronya or Ruan Mei, but the payoff for the slightly longer wait is pure TNT dynamite.Supports that affect enemy DEF or RES are also very good for Boothill. This is another point for Ruan Mei thanks to her Ultimate, but it also includes the likes of Pela and Silver Wolf. Both of these Nihility debuffers can reduce enemy DEF quite easily and consistently, greatly improving the Break DMG Boothill can do, but I want to put particular attention on Silver Wolf; she is entirely single-target focused, but since Boothill is too, it's not that big of a deal, and Silver Wolf provides a greater DEF shred than Pela does. The other benefit is that Silver Wolf can also implant Weaknesses onto enemies, Physical for Boothill while he waits for his Ultimate to come back, or Quantum to enable Boothill to fully utilise the 4 piece benefits of the Genius of Brilliant Stars Relic set. Especially if you are looking to erase Bosses, Silver Wolf is a great pick if you have her.Lastly, the absolute best choices for a sustain for a Boothill team are the aforementioned Gallagher and Aventurine. Gallagher's Talent just straight-up increases the team's Break DMG by up to 12%, and the only cost of this is doing what you were already going to be doing. Gallagher himself also deals a silly amount of Toughness damage, so especially if the enemy is weak to Fire, he's a great pick, and he's a 4-star character, so he's quite accessible. Aventurine is pretty universally good but you're more likely to be using him with Boothill if you're looking to maximise the benefits of River Flows in Spring (the Light Cone from before). The other notable benefits of both Gallagher and Aventurine is that they have no trouble sustaining the entire team while being completely SP positive, and that they contribute a huge amount of Toughness damage themselves. The SP is not something you need to worry about for Boothill himself, but something that is of extreme value when you consider that Boothill\u2019s best amplifying support options are quite SP hungry themselves (Bronya, Harmony Trailblazer). The Toughness damage also means that especially if enemies are weak to both Physical and either of the elements of the two sustains mentioned, it just makes Boothill even more easy to pilot. You can use any sustain you want, but these two are leagues ahead of the rest for the Galaxy Ranger.Beyond that, there's not much else to say. Boothill is just a really damn good character, and because of his Break-heavy focus, he's likely to stay relevant for a very long time, especially thanks to his guaranteed Weakness Implant and forced Break DMG against Broken enemies.Though his charm is infectious, do not forget that he's seen his fair share of the universe. Take him with you wherever you travel and he's gonna carry that weight.See you, Space Cowboy."

Against Quantum weak enemies this set is Boothill's current best performer and even against non-quantum weak enemies while it does fall behind some other sets on this list, it's still a reasonable boost. What makes this set a little more appealing is that its performance only increases the more DEF shred you get, something Boothill is interested in already - in fact his Signature and some of his Eidolons have quite a bit of it."

            "formatted": "Bronya is an exceptionally potent Harmony support. She can Advance a single ally's Action by 100%, functionally giving them another turn before their time, and gives them a large DMG boost. She also increases the whole team's ATK and additionally their CRIT DMG based on how much CRIT DMG Bronya herself has. She is a quintessential support character for hypercarry setups where SP consumption is not a concern.Bronya is possibly one of the most complex characters in the game to maximise. Her abilities lend themselves perfectly to boosting the absolute heck out of a single teammate but require her to be perfectly tuned to said teammate's SPD. Add in the potential to shift Bronya herself in the turn order from her Talent and you have the biggest headache in this game. Not even Yukong is as mentally taxing as Bronya is.Because SPD is such an important stat when talking about Bronya, you may think that it is important that you understand what SPD is. It's convoluted, that's for sure, but I can safely say that you do not need to understand SPD at its most fundamental to be able to use Bronya. There are plenty of other theorycrafters, calc people, and content creators who have done the difficult task of compiling what SPD Bronya needs to be at for a given damage dealer SPD, including the most common values.All of this is essentially because you want to maximise the value of the 100% Action Advance on Bronya's Skill. She targets a single ally, dispels 1 debuff from them, increases their DMG by up to 66%, and Action Advances them by 100%, meaning it is now their turn once more. The best way for this Skill to be used is literally immediately after your damage dealer has already acted \u2014 and I do mean immediately. That little number you see on character portraits in the turn order? Yeah, Bronya should be immediately after your current damage dealer's turn and that number should ideally be as close to 1 as possible.This is what has lead to colloquial descriptions of Bronya playstyles such as 'Slow Bronya' in which she is SPD tuned to have 1 fewer point of SPD compared to the DPS (so if your DPS has 134 SPD, Bronya should have 133 or so), or 'Hyper Bronya' in which Bronya goes plus ultra on her SPD stat to around the 170s or even higher if that's even possible, and you just relentlessly Action Advance your preferably low SPD damage dealer.This gets even more interesting with Bronya's Talent. After using her Basic ATK, Bronya's own Action will be Advanced Forward by up to 30%. You get more turn per turn, essentially. This is also how Bronya can 'fix' her spot in the turn order by quite literally just shifting herself up until she's where she needs to be. This leads to other various forms of 'alternating' playstyles, in which Bronya alternates between Skill and Basic ATK to keep herself and her damage dealer aligned.It's... a lot, I know. However, I will say that you can definitely get a feel for all of this by just playing her over time, especially under unfavourable circumstances. Bronya's Talent and Skill can fix a lot of unsavoury situations during combat, and there's really no need to strictly adhere to one SPD value or Bronya playstyle unless you're trying to be fully, maximally, optimal. Again, there are plenty of resources online for figuring all of this out, as well as calculators to find your optimal speeds.Bronya's Ultimate increases the ATK of all allies by up to 55%, and increases their CRIT DMG by up to 16% of Bronya's CRIT DMG plus 20% for 2 turns. This can result in a very powerful CRIT buff for your damage dealers, especially if Bronya is built for a lot of CRIT DMG. At an average cost of 120 Energy, this can be up fairly frequently, potentially having full uptime with the proper Light Cones and maybe some luck here and there. CRIT buffs are extremely powerful because they're usually quite rare, and now factoring in her Skill as well, Bronya is capable of providing ATK%, DMG%, and CDMG% to your damage dealer.Amusingly enough, the single strongest thing she has is the Action Advance \u2014 more turns equals more damage. It's probably the simplest part of her whole kit. The only issue with this is the exorbitant SP costs attempting to maintain frequent Skill usages. This is where the alternating playstyles come in, but these playstyles have inexorable damage losses associated with them compared to just spamming her Skill. Maintaining good SP economy is paramount to seeing success with Bronya over extended fights. I specify extended because if you just kill the enemies fast enough that you don't run out of SP, well then you no longer really have a problem there.Bronya's Bonus Traces don't really change anything besides providing nice passive bonuses. A2 increases the CRIT chance of her Basic ATK to 100%, A4 provides a 20% DEF boost for 2 turns upon entering combat, and A6 provides a permanent 10% DMG buff for as long as Bronya is alive and on the field.Her Eidolons are something that players may get over time due to her being a standard 5-star character. They are all quite impressive, meaning Bronya scales even better with Eidolons. E1 is a great starting point since it gives her Skill a 50% fixed chance of refunding a Skill Point on use, with a 1 turn cooldown. This greatly alleviates the SP concerns from spamming her Skill and is so valuable that many players opt to use their 300 standard pull guarantee on a second copy of Bronya just for this. That decision is ultimately up to the player, but it is verifiably good.Because of Bronya's Skill's 1 turn duration, the DMG boost actually doesn't catch a fair few things from certain damage dealers, making the pair rather incompatible. The biggest ones to note are follow-up attackers like Topaz, Dr. Ratio, and especially Jing Yuan, characters where the vast majority of their damage comes outside of their turn. This is why E6 Bronya is the dream, as E6 extends the duration of the DMG buff from 1 turn to 2 turns, meaning everyone gets to benefit from it unconditionally.That's essentially the crux of Bronya. If a damage dealer can benefit fully from her, she is near automatically the strongest support for them, but as soon as that stops being true, suddenly other support options can start to be more appealing. Especially with the investment requirement constantly changing if you wish to use her with different DPS characters, plus the knowledge check of SPD as a whole, even if Bronya objectively results in the best outcome for a team, you may just opt not to use her.This is because Bronya has a lot more competition these days, mostly from Ruan Mei. Ruan Mei also provides ridiculous buffs but they are teamwide and completely effortless by comparison to Bronya's. As much as there would need to be another support character with Action Advance to directly challenge Bronya's throne, Ruan Mei's team influence is honestly not very far off from Bronya's, and Ruan Mei also provides much appreciated defensive utility with her increased Breaking and Break Extensions. There's nothing stopping you from playing them both together though as long as you have the SP to sustain it.Bronya's just great. Even if someone else eventually comes to steal her throne... Well you'll probably just use them both together, hah."

            "formatted": "Clara is a strong retaliation-based DPS character. She has inherent damage reduction and will immediately counterattack enemies that hit her with a follow-up attack. Enemies countered will be marked and will take double damage from her Skill. Her Ultimate increases her damage reduction and greatly increases the likelihood of her getting attacked, as well as temporarily boosting her counters further.Clara has not changed much since the launch of the game, but opinions surrounding her have. Nowadays it\u2019s not a surprise to hear people say Clara is one of the best standard 5-star characters and is even competitive with some limited 5-stars as well. She\u2019s a straightforward and strong unit.The biggest source of damage comes from her Talent. Clara has a passive 10% damage reduction and enemies that hit her will get shot by Svarog. This counter deals up to 160% ATK and counts as a follow-up attack. It has no cooldown whatsoever and costs nothing, meaning that Clara gets increasing damage against faster-acting enemies. Each counter also regenerates 5 Energy.Her Skill deals up to 120% ATK to all enemies on the field. Enemies that are countered get a status called Mark of Counter which doubles the damage they take from Clara\u2019s next Skill. All Marks are removed after the Skill is used. As a true AoE ability, this is a very rare thing for a Destruction character to have, especially because of how strong it actually ends up being. 120% ATK to all enemies is already above average for an AoE Skill among Erudition units, but being able to potentially get 240% ATK out of it against all enemies is exceptional. This makes it good even in single-target scenarios, but it makes it an absolute force to be reckoned with in multi-target situations.Clara\u2019s Ultimate increases her Talent\u2019s damage reduction by up to an extra 25% and greatly increases the chance of enemies targeting her. Both of these effects have a 2 turn duration. In addition to this, Svarog\u2019s counter is enhanced and has its damage doubled to 320% ATK, as well as converting it into a Blast AoE that splashes 160% ATK to adjacent foes. This can occur for 2 counters before reverting to the usual counter.These Enhanced counters can end up dealing up to 640% ATK if hitting 3 targets, and entirely outside of Clara\u2019s turn. While you only get 2 Enhanced counters per Ultimate usage, the other effects of the Ultimate last the full 2 turns, meaning it is likely you will get many more normal counters off before the increased aggro wears off. The damage reduction also goes a long way to guaranteeing that Clara doesn\u2019t just fall over while taking all these enemy attacks.This Ultimate has a below-average cost of 110 Energy, which is important because of the way Clara is played; Clara wants to be hit as often as possible and wants to make maximum use of her Ultimate\u2019s secondary effects, and as such she wants to remain at her default SPD \u2014 the absolute lowest base SPD in the game at 90. With the Energy she receives from getting hit and the Energy she gets from her counters, it is not uncommon to maintain a near 100% uptime on her Ultimate\u2019s effects, especially when facing the stronger and faster enemies encountered in the end game.This does also imply that slow enemies are something of a hurdle for Clara, as well as enemies that do not always attack on their turn. It\u2019s not a huge deal most of the time because the few enemies who fit these descriptions aren\u2019t Physical weak, but it is something you need to keep in mind.The same note as before still applies; because Clara wishes to be the sole target for enemies, she does not want to be paired with teammates who are likely to steal aggro from her, such as Gepard or Preservation Trailblazer. This is a lot less of an issue these days as there are plenty of fantastic sustain options available that do not interfere with Clara\u2019s pseudo-tanking ability.The most accessible of these is Lynx, and Lynx\u2019s Skill specifically increases the aggro that Preservation and Destruction units have. Clara fits the description of the latter, and her extremely low base SPD coupled with infinite counters makes for highly efficient use of ally buffs, and so both Clara and Lynx have high synergy with each other. Luocha as well is very efficient and can turn Clara into a sort of teamwide healer thanks to the frequency of her counters coupled with the healing field of Abyss Flower.However, even more impressive of a pair is Huohuo. Huohuo can give Energy to the whole team and her method of healing makes it very difficult for Clara to ever die. In addition to this, Huohuo has plentiful cleanses meaning that it is also far easier for Clara to shake off pesky crowd control effects that would otherwise prevent any counters from going out. Add all of this on top of Huohuo\u2019s 40% ATK buff that Clara can also make extremely efficient use of, and Huohuo pretty much becomes Clara\u2019s best sustain teammate.Clara\u2019s Bonus Traces are boring but effective. A2 has a 35% fixed chance to remove a debuff on her whenever she\u2019s attacked, making it possible to circumvent anything from annoying DMG Down debuffs to debilitating crowd control effects, though do keep in mind it will not prevent the application of any of these, it\u2019ll only take effect after the next hit. A4 expounds on this by giving a 35% resistance to crowd control effects. Finally, A6 provides an unconditional 30% DMG bonus to all Svarog counters, significantly improving her damage even more.As a standard 5-star character it is not unlikely to get Eidolons for Clara over time. None of them are really necessary for Clara to excel but I do want to point out E1 as a very high value pickup. E1 makes Marks of Counter permanent, meaning after the first time an enemy gets countered, they will forever take double damage from Clara\u2019s Skill, which is unsurprisingly, very very powerful, and also helps improve the overall consistency of the Skill\u2019s damage.There is a slight degree of variance in Clara\u2019s damage output due to her needing to be hit, but even the low end is quite competitive, and the higher end is honestly somewhat frightening. My initial prediction ended up being mostly true \u2014 Clara has stayed very useful throughout everything thus far, and I\u2019m willing to wager once more that this will continue to be the case."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Dan Heng is a purely single-target damage dealer who is quite strong in the early stages of the game. He is unable to activate his Talent\u2019s RES PEN on his own, requiring an ally to target him with an Ability first, and also requires his primary target to also be Slowed to make the most of his Ultimate. He remains a solid damage dealer throughout most stages of the game, but can struggle to keep up in the late game without very heavy investment.Dan Heng is one of the first characters the player gains access to and is the third of the main trio of characters. He is the complementary single-target focused damage dealer to Destruction Trailblazer\u2019s generalist spread and March\u2019s defensive utility. As such, he is designed with the early story and subsequent fights in mind, meaning he can quite easily start to fall off if the player does not continue to invest in him.Dan Heng\u2019s Skill deals up to 260% ATK to a single enemy, with a 100% base chance to Slow the enemy by 12% for 2 turns on a CRIT Hit. The upfront multiplier is a little higher than equivalent Skills, but Dan Heng has fewer ways to increase it further. The Slow itself is important for Dan Heng\u2019s Ultimate and relies on you landing CRITs with the actual Skill. It\u2019s not too bad as the Skill hits 4 times in total and each one can roll the Slow, so this offsets the fact that Dan Heng will never want to build for Effect Hit Rate.Enemies naturally get faster and faster as the player levels up and reaches later stages of the game, but a 12% Slow is very rarely going to be the difference maker and this is not something that should be relied on for any meaningful reduction in enemy action or efficacy. This Slow should pretty much exclusively be considered as a priming tool for Dan Heng\u2019s Ultimate.Dan Heng\u2019s Ultimate deals a single large hit of 400% ATK to an enemy. If the target enemy is Slowed, the Ultimate\u2019s Multiplier increases by 120%, for a new total of 520%. This actually is a very impressive multiplier as very few other abilities hit this hard, especially at such a measly Energy cost of only 100. It is very easy for Dan Heng to have his Ultimate up very frequently because of this Energy cost, and additions of teammates such as Tingyun or Huohuo can easily give Dan Heng near back to back Ultimates.An issue that can arise is the small minigame of trying to optimise his Ultimate\u2019s damage, needing the enemy to be Slowed for maximum effect. Even though his Skill hits 4 times, they still need to be CRITs to have a chance of applying the Slow, and there is a non-zero chance that even if all 4 hits are CRITs you still don\u2019t end up getting the Slow. Another potential thing to occur is that the enemy\u2019s Slow duration runs out before you are able to reapply it.\u00a0This leads to the very real issue of having Dan Heng\u2019s Ultimate ready to be used but the enemy is not primed, and so you lose out on an Ability multiplier of 120%. This is a colossal damage loss when it occurs, and there is not always a way to avoid it. You could of course hold off on using Dan Heng\u2019s Ultimate for a turn to try and inflict the Slow on the enemy, but with such a low cost Ultimate this leads to very significant overcapping of Energy, and doing so can very easily cost you entire uses of his Ultimate later in the fight.Dan Heng\u2019s Talent is also very strong. When Dan Heng is targeted by an ally Ability, his next attack gains 36% Wind RES PEN. This has a 2 turn cooldown before it can be activated again. Resistance Penetration is a separate part of the DMG Formula, meaning this is a very powerful effect to have, and it\u2019s extraordinarily rare. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a lot more difficult for Dan Heng to make use of this powerful Talent because of its punishing requirements.To clarify, the Talent will only activate if Dan Heng is explicitly targeted by an ally Ability, meaning you have to see the blue targeting reticle on top of Dan Heng. Any Abilities that affect allies without first targeting them will not activate this Talent; Yukong\u2019s Roaring Bowstrings, Preservation Trailblazer\u2019s Talent, any Regeneration effects \u2014 none of these will trigger his Talent.\u2018But what if I want to get an Ultimate on an enemy that is already Slowed while also having my Talent ready to go to give the Ultimate the 36% RES PEN?\u2019 We have now arrived at the crux of the issue: how the heck are you supposed to reliably get this to happen? Yes, having a single attack dealing 520% ATK with 36% RES PEN attached is undoubtedly going to hit absurdly hard, especially since the RES PEN is not going to be diluted by support character\u2019s buffs, but the conditions to meet it consistently are perhaps edging closer to unreasonable.Because you will inevitably experience a situation in which you cannot Ult onto a Slowed enemy, or maybe you get Dan Heng\u2019s Talent back before his Ultimate is ready, the way to handle this is to simply not care. No, really, in the grand scheme of things it doesn\u2019t matter what order you choose to do things in, and Dan Heng\u2019s Skill can also benefit greatly from his Talent\u2019s effects. Try to activate his Talent every time you can and you\u2019ll naturally see a large damage increase; the 2 turn cooldown makes trying to fully optimise it to be used with his Ultimate near impossible in practice, and most assuredly not worth the headache.Dan Heng\u2019s Major Traces do not assist in alleviating these issues, but do provide noticeable bonuses. A2 reduces the chances of Dan Heng being attacked while he is at or below 50% Max HP, which is pretty much useless later on as there is still an element of luck involved, and staying below 50% health is pretty much asking to die in one more hit. A6 will increase the DMG of his Basic ATK by 40% against Slowed enemies. Ideally you should never need to use his Basic ATK but in the rare event you do, this will make it less of a damage loss.His A4 is very significant as it has a 50% fixed chance to increase Dan Heng\u2019s SPD by 20% for 2 turns after launching any attack. Percentage SPD increases only care about the character\u2019s Base SPD, and Dan Heng\u2019s happens to be the second highest in the game at 110, meaning this gives him a free 22 SPD. As it\u2019s a fixed chance, it\u2019s relatively easy to maintain as well so long as you\u2019re not holding off on using his Ultimate, making Dan Heng quite the speedy damage dealer if you have other SPD boosts.His Eidolons are not technically necessary for him to do well, but they are definitely welcome as they can quite significantly improve his performance. E2 in particular is a huge damage boost if the player is able to make use of it; his Talent\u2019s cooldown is reduced to only 1 turn, meaning every other turn can be buffed by the Wind RES PEN. This not only makes it a lot easier to have it available for his Ultimate, but also to improve his damage outside of his Ultimate.\u00a0Dan Heng can perform very well, like shockingly well, if well invested and if the player takes the time to learn his intricacies. Alas, it is undeniable that the amount of effort he demands is usually better used on other characters that are more generally usable. The complicated nature of his damage optimisations coupled with being exclusively single-target means he is rarely going to be players\u2019 first choice. Especially if the player only has enough patience for one complex unit at a time, Qingque is vastly more deserving of that attention, as not only is she also entirely free but has the potential to challenge limited 5-star characters in terms of overall power.\u00a0Again, if you like him or wish to use him for some other reasons, your loyalty can definitely be rewarded. He can deal stupidly impressive damage as long as you\u2019re willing to give him a fair shot. If you have Eidolons for him, consider giving him a try, especially if you\u2019re lacking Wind options. He may only be single target in nature, but he can make sure that those singular targets become dust."

After achieving these goals ATK% can be searched for as a bonus.SPEED: Speed (as with most standard direct damage carries) is incredibly important on Dr. Ratio. Hitting a strong breakpoint is also advised when aiming to achieve the fastest and most comfortable endgame clears in Memory of Chaos and Pure Fiction. Remember you can gain speed via team mates buff such as Asta, Ruan Mei, and Hanya.CRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: Ratio has abundant access to CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG but they are still his top stats. Aim for a traditional 1:2 ratio of CRIT and CRIT DMG - it's quite easy to cap out Ratio's CRIT at 100% and reach over 200% Crit DMG. CRIT DMG still remains a top priority for increasing damage further in endgame though.ATK% & DMG%: Both are competitive stats on Ratio but ATK% is more valuable than usual compared to other damage dealers thanks to Ratio's bonus ability granting him up to 50% increased damage against enemies that have 5 debuffs. If you can consistently gain the maximum effect of this bonus you can consider ATK% to be close in value to DMG% especially if you're pairing him with a DMG% Light Cone and support."

When mixing and matching you can make use of any of the following 2P sets.Musketeer of Wild WheatAllows Ratio to reach higher Speed breakpoints with less sub-stat investment and offers some ATK%. Easy to farm and generic but not as good as previous alternatives.The Ashblazing Grand DukeFalls behind other 4P and 2P set combinations as Ratio can only apply 1 stack of the 4P bonus per attack.Firmament Frontline: GlamothOne of the top choices for Ratio assuming you can reach 135 speed at all times but very close in performance to alternatives. If your team compositions or gear sets can reach 160+ Speed without sacrificing other stats it becomes his best option in many cases.Inert SalsottoOffers Crit Rate assisting Ratio with reaching his desired ratio of 100% Crit and 200% Crit DMG while also boosting his main source of damage Follow-Up attacks. Close to identical numerical performance as Frontline Glamoth in most cases.Space Sealing StationAn excellent generic set that is easy to acquire and is only slightly behind Inert Salsotto and FFG in performance. Rutilant ArenaAn alternative to Ratio's best 3 planar sets but does fall behind when looking to maximise damage and potential of the character. Still a viable option if you have a great set with good sub-stats."

            "formatted": "Dr. Ratio is a very powerful single-target damage dealer, given out for free to all players from 1.6 to until the start of 2.1. He specialises in dealing immense damage through follow-ups and accumulating permanent CRIT buffs in combat. He also benefits noticeably from attacking debuffed enemies, guaranteeing his follow-up at 3 debuffs and receiving a DMG bonus per stack, maxing out at 5 debuffs. The ways he can use his follow-up attack both provide more Energy over time than other characters and can somewhat alleviate the usual inherent weakness of Hunt characters.The abrasive meme-lord with a heart of gold, Dr. Veritas Ratio finally graces us with his presence. Giving us the ability to play him early with a Trial version taught us much about his capabilities, and now that he\u2019s here for real, it\u2019s fairly apparent that he was actually holding out on us.Before going into the usual breakdown, some important information first. Since debuffs are very important for Dr. Ratio\u2019s kit, you should know what exactly constitutes a debuff in this game. The rule is this: if a Status Effect features a small red arrow pointing downwards, this is considered a debuff. If you are in doubt, you can inspect the Enemy Details window in combat and the Status Summary at the bottom will explicitly state how many debuffs they are currently afflicted with. If you don\u2019t read this paragraph, you forfeit the right to complain later when you discover Hanya\u2019s Burden isn\u2019t a debuff.Dr. Ratio\u2019s Skill is a standard single-target Skill, dealing up to 150% of his ATK to a single enemy. This may initially seem rather low but this Skill works in tandem with his Talent as well as his Bonus Ability Traces, leading to far greater damage numbers for the meagre cost of 1 Skill Point.His Talent is his main source of damage. When using his Skill, he has a 40% fixed chance to launch a follow-up attack against his target, dealing up to an impressive 270% ATK. Each debuff the target of his Skill is affected by will increase the fixed chance of this follow-up occurring by 20%. This means that if the targeted enemy has at least 3 debuffs on them, Dr. Ratio will always follow a Skill usage with a Talent follow-up, dealing a combined 420% ATK to a single enemy. Very dank, and very strong.It should be noted that if his Skill defeats the target before the follow-up can be launched, Ratio will launch it anyway against a random other enemy. This prevents much of the value from being lost due to an early enemy death, but more importantly it helps to alleviate the natural downside of the Path of The Hunt, namely that they are exclusively single-target focused. In a similar sort of vein as Seele can use lesser enemies to bolster her offence, Ratio can pick off smaller foes and weakened stragglers and still deal damage against the remaining foes; with an upfront damage multiplier of 150% on his Skill, it is not unreasonable to expect this to deal with trash adds outright with proper setup. This automatically puts Ratio far ahead of pretty much all other Hunt units besides Seele.Dr. Ratio\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 240% ATK to a single enemy and applies a status effect called Wiseman\u2019s Folly (it's not a debuff). Whenever allies attack a target with Wiseman\u2019s Folly, Dr. Ratio will automatically launch a follow-up attack against them out of turn. This can happen 2 times before the status effect is automatically removed. This lasts indefinitely unless the afflicted enemy dies or until the trigger count is met.This Ultimate allows Ratio to deal even more damage outside of his turn and use buffs even more efficiently. There is however an issue with this Ultimate, and that is that the debuff is removed when the enemy dies. It does not hop like Topaz\u2019s Proof of Debt, meaning if an enemy dies before the trigger count is met for Ratio\u2019s Ultimate, he completely loses the effects of the Ultimate. Given that this admittedly strong Ultimate has a steep cost of 140 Energy, losing its effects is miserable to have happen even if you\u2019ve already gotten one follow-up off. Mostly if this happens, sorry, it\u2019s a skill issue. This should only ever naturally occur at the very end of combat when it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.Another important thing to note is that because of the amount of follow-ups Ratio throws, his Energy economy is actually surprisingly good since each Talent follow-up gives 5 Energy; assuming you\u2019re attacking an enemy with at least 3 debuffs, his Skill gives 35 Energy per cast, and his Ultimate provides 10 additional Energy once the Wiseman\u2019s Folly follow-ups have been expended. The amount of follow-ups also contributes to a very impressive amount of overall Toughness damage, with each one dealing 30 Toughness damage, the same as a typical Basic ATK. Combining with his Skill again, each one of his turns he will be dealing 90 Toughness damage, the equivalent of all single-target Ultimates besides Xueyi\u2019s.Dr. Ratio\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces provide some very powerful additional effects. A2 will provide permanent stacks of 2.5% CRIT Rate and 5% CRIT DMG whenever he uses his Skill against a debuffed enemy. The number of stacks he gets depends on the number of debuffs the enemy has on them, and he can have up to 6 stacks in total, granting 15% CRIT Rate and 30% CRIT DMG. This passive has sparked some confusion due to its wording, so to be as clear as possible, the bonuses do not need to be obtained concurrently; if an enemy has only 3 debuffs on them, you will gain the full 6 stacks after two Skill uses against them; if they only have 2, you will need three Skill uses to get the 6 stacks.His A4 gives his Skill a 100% base chance to reduce the target\u2019s Effect RES by 10% for 2 turns, giving Ratio an inherent debuff to apply to enemies. This debuff also becomes easier to maintain on enemies after its initial application due to the Effect RES reduction it provides. This also means teammates only need to provide 2 additional debuffs to meet the 100% follow-up chance on Skill use from his Talent. Do note that this debuff is only applied after the follow-up check occurs, meaning if you\u2019re relying on this as your 3rd debuff, your first follow-up won\u2019t have a 100% fixed chance to happen.A6 will grant Ratio a DMG% buff for attacking debuffed enemies. This effect starts functioning at 3 debuffs and maxes out at 5, providing 10% DMG dealt for each debuff. This means that having 5 debuffs will give him a bonus 50% DMG dealt against the target with a 100% fixed chance to throw follow-ups on Skill uses, resulting in colossal damage output, but so long as you can meet the 3 debuff threshold for his Talent, 30% DMG dealt is perfectly acceptable as well. 100% chance for his follow-up is the most important milestone to reach, so don\u2019t bend over backwards going for 5 debuffs if the team can\u2019t attain it or if it\u2019d result in a worse team composition.Dr. Ratio also gets 12% CRIT Rate from his Minor Traces as well as 28% ATK. \u2018Why are you mentioning ATK Traces?\u2019 Because, as of the time of writing this, Dr. Ratio has the absolute highest Base ATK value in the game of 776, meaning ATK% bonuses will have a more noticeable impact on his overall ATK rating.Dr. Ratio\u2019s Eidolons are downright silly. Absolutely none of them are necessary in any way. Ratio is immaculate by default, at E0. However, for those\u2026 \u2018Driven\u2019 few who will pursue his Eidolons, you may see actual oneshots. E1 allows A6 CRIT buffs to stack to 10, E2 causes his follow-up to deal 20% additional ATK damage per debuff against debuffed enemies, up to an 80% ATK bonus per follow-up, E4 basically refills Ratio\u2019s Energy bar in mere moments by giving 15 Energy back per follow-up, and E6 increases the number of Ultimate triggers to 3 while also increasing the DMG dealt by the follow-up by a massive 50%. I\u2019m fully ready to see True Sting die to a singular piece of chalk.As you can no doubt tell from what\u2019s been said already, a very significant portion of Ratio\u2019s total damage comes from his follow-up attack, but even more than that, it\u2019s a majority of his damage. If you are unable to meet the minimum requirements of 3 debuffs to activate his follow-up attack, you will haemorrhage damage. There are only benefits to reap by meeting this baseline as it unlocks all the aforementioned great parts of his kit: his overall damage throughput, his remarkable Energy economy and Toughness damage, and even a minor ability to break out of his otherwise pure single-target damage profile.As such, Ratio pairs very well with characters that can enable or amplify his capabilities. For the strongest single-target specialist team in the game, pairing him with Topaz is very powerful. Topaz has been waiting for a follow-up damage dealer who is able to both benefit from her debuff and increase the frequency of her own follow-up attacks, and Dr. Ratio fits that description perfectly. Ratio already deals so much single-target damage that it\u2019s a viable strategy to focus down and kill summoner enemies outright, ignoring their summons entirely, and with Topaz\u2019s powerful Vulnerability debuff, Ratio can do this even easier. Do note that without Topaz\u2019s E1 or S1, you will need to find a source of at least 1 more debuff.To that end, the usual suite of Nihility debuffers are fantastic to round out the rest of the team. It\u2019s important to know that all Nihility characters can equip the Light Cone Resolution Shines As Pearls of Sweat, providing an extra debuff and decreasing enemies\u2019 DEF. Pela can keep her Ultimate\u2019s DEF Shred up pretty much indefinitely on all enemies, making it easier to switch to new targets when Ratio\u2019s chalk deals the finishing blow, but it is only 1 consistent debuff without Resolution. Silver Wolf is understandably fantastic for racking up huge amounts of debuffs on single targets even at E0, and with the right setup, a single Skill usage from Silver Wolf can very nearly enable Dr. Ratio\u2019s entire kit while also being able to ensure the enemy has an Imaginary Weakness thanks to her Skill\u2019s Weakness Implant.Guinaifen in particular is a very impressive character to pair with Ratio, as both her Burn and Firekiss Vulnerability count towards Ratio\u2019s debuff count, simultaneously increasing his damage output and dealing good damage of her own. Especially in AoE scenarios, this can greatly offset Ratio\u2019s weaker AoE capabilities by either dealing with smaller enemies outright, or by softening them up enough that Ratio can kill them with his Skill and then throw his follow-up on a completely different target.If gaining enough debuffs is not a concern then Ratio of course also has access to the usual suite of Harmony characters as well. Bronya, Ruan Mei, and Tingyun are all very good at significantly increasing the damage Dr. Ratio can deal; Bronya can double Ratio\u2019s action count with the right SPD tuning, Tingyun\u2019s Benediction blessing getting a lot of value due to follow-ups not consuming it, and Ruan Mei for even faster and stronger Breaking. Ruan Mei in particular also provides a debuff of her own thanks to her Ultimate but, due to its cost, this should not be relied on to meet the minimum debuff threshold for Dr. Ratio.A final note is that Dr. Ratio\u2019s signature Light Cone is exceptionally powerful on him in particular. Ratio is absolutely fine and strong with the likes of Cruising in the Stellar Sea, but his performance goes up by that much more with his signature Light Cone, and it provides better quality of life than trying to maintain the passives of other Light Cone options. Again, Ratio is being evaluated here with the easily and freely accessible options and he\u2019s already guaranteed to swat everything away with little effort, but he gets that much stronger with his sig. It\u2019s very much a case of \u2018gold versus platinum\u2019 so it\u2019s up to the individual to decide if they think it\u2019s worth chasing that extra dazzle.Dr. Ratio is not a complicated character once you\u2019ve understood how he works, and he works with a vast array of other characters, fitting in nicely among the rest of the roster. Being given out for free as well means that everyone can benefit from his impeccable damage output, made even more valuable by being an Imaginary damage dealer, something that\u2019s still lacking to this day. He has a few peculiarities that he needs met to really get going, but once he does he really gets going.If you\u2019re reading this from the future after 2.1 when Ratio leaves our collective inboxes, and you\u2019ve missed out on getting him for free, you had ample time to pick the man up because that\u2019s months away from the time I\u2019m writing this. Take this L, sans the Ratio, obviously.For the rest of us, the doctor\u2026 Is in."

SPEED: Speed is an essential stat for Firefly as it enables her to hit an incredibly potent Speed breakpoint within her kit, allowing her to execute 4 Enhanced Skills during her Ultimate as opposed the the usual 3. This is of course on top of all the usual benefits Speed provides. Almost all of Firefly's damage stems from her Enhanced Skills so it goes without saying every Firefly around is going to want the 4th one and fortunately it's not too hard. Here is how much Speed you'll need exactly in a number of different scenarios to get that 4 skill activation: 210 Speed total while in the Combustion state is the goal,This translates to needing 150 Speed before the Combustion state (you'll get 60 when entering the state),When using Ruan Mei or similar permanent Speed buffers that grant roughly 10% you can get away with 140/141 Speed (Ruan Mei grants 10% which is 10.4 Speed for Firefly),165 Speed (or higher) outside the Combustion state guarantees you an extra action in Cycle 0 of Memory of Chaos.Break Effect%: When playing Firefly outside of stacking enough Speed to hit her 4-skill breakpoint your other main objective is hitting 360% Break Effect (while buffed) to enable her 50% Super Break bonus ability. Also, thanks to the vast majority of Firefly's damage of course being break-related stacking Break Effect % is simply the best way to increase her damage from raw stats. Outside of Speed and ATK% (as it can become Break), Break Effect is the only stat Firefly really has to pursue so don't be stingy when targetting it even at the cost of all other damage sub-stats you might be used to like CRIT. ATK%: ATK is a funny stat for Firefly as she doesn't gain close to anything from the traditional uses of the stat with all of her damage being from BREAK and SUPER BREAK. The sole purpose of the ATK stat on Firefly is to gain the additional bonuses from having over 1800 of it from her bonus ability Module y: Core Overload granting her 0.8% Break Effect for every 10 ATK over 1800. This exchange is quite a good one but still doesn't make stacking Attack as good as stacking pure Break Effect - although if you've got a high base Attack Cone equipped, it can get quite close when comparing sub-stats for example (keep in mind though Firefly's signature has low base ATK for a 5 star Cone so Break will still be better). As a general rule Break is generally always the better option when comparing the two but taking 2 ATK% subs over 1 BREAK EFFECT % sub might be something to consider especially with the high base Attack in mind.

What makes Ruan Mei so strong with Firefly and Trailblazer is her increase to Break Efficiency which directly scales Super Break damage - and it makes up the majority of the Firefly x Trailblazer duo's damage. Firefly has some Break Efficiency of her own and Ruan's does stack additively with that but even so, it's a huge damage increase. On top of this, Ruan Mei offers not only Break Effect and Speed to the team but also RES SHRED which of course massively increases BREAK and SUPER BREAK damage as well. Ruan's Speed buff specifically can make gearing up Firefly for the correct Speed breakpoints much easier."

One of Firefly's (and her teams) biggest issues at E0 is not having enough Skill Points. Firefly herself is an extremely fast character with an action advance built into her kit, Harmony Trailblazer would ideally use their skill whenever possible to maximize their damage and energy regeneration, and Ruan Mei wants to maintain her skill at all times. The result of this is not a lot of Skill Points to go around - something Gallagher as a character (with the potential to have the most positive skill point rotation of any sustain) helps immensely with. Another thing Firefly is constantly on the lookout for is keeping as many enemies broken as frequently and for as long as possible, allowing her to Super Break them every action - Gallagher being a Breaker himself also helps with this thanks to his incredible toughness damage. Finally, Gallagher also amplifies Break Damage as well, boosting the overall team's damage."

            "formatted": "Firefly is a remarkable Break-focused unit. She can regain her Ultimate extremely fast with her Skill's percentage restore and has a natural 25% Action Advance when using said Skill, though it also consumes HP to use. With her Ultimate, she immediately Advances her turn by 100% and gains vastly increased SPD, Damage Reduction, Effect RES, and Weakness Break Efficiency when attacking enemies. During her Ultimate, she will also be able to heal herself when using her Enhanced attacks, and she will implant a Fire Weakness onto the main target of her Enhanced Skill. She has a very synergistic kit that lends itself to having many ways of improving over time.Ah, finally, everyone's favourite Kamen Rider, Gundam, Orbital Frame, Samfly soon will become playable! There's a frightening lot about her that's great and a little about her that's somewhat rigid for now, but all of this culminates in one of the highest ceiling characters we've gotten so far. To leave it at that wouldn't be telling the whole story, but make no mistake, Firefly is definitely on par - or even better - than the likes of Acheron and has no trouble wiping the floor with pretty much everything that breathes. Her kit is very interlinked, so We'll start with Firefly's Ultimate. It has a colossal cost of 240 Energy, though this is not as limiting as it may initially seem. Upon using the Ultimate, Firefly enters the Complete Combustion state. She gets a 100% Action Advance, meaning it is now her turn, and she gains up to 60 SPD. She gains access to an Enhanced Basic ATK and Enhanced Skill, and the Weakness Break Efficiency of these Enhanced attacks is increased by 50% and the Break DMG received by enemies is increased by up to 20%.This Ultimate state gets a separate countdown timer in the Action Order, much like Robin's Ultimate, with a fixed SPD of 70. The Ultimate may not be recast before it expires, but if you defeat all enemies within a cycle in Memory of Chaos, you can extend the effects of the Ultimate as the fixed SPD countdown gets thrown back down the Action Order. By default, this allows SAM to perform 3 Enhanced attacks per Ultimate usage.Her Talent provides her with DMG Reduction based on how low her health is, capping out when her health is at or below 20% Max HP and giving her up to a 40% DMG Reduction. However, during her Ultimate she will always have the maximum amount, and additionally gain 30% Effect RES on top. When her Energy reaches 100% in combat, all of her debuffs will be dispelled, meaning she will almost never be subject to pesky stat-reducing debuffs when she goes to destroy enemies in her Ultimate. This Talent will also ensure Firefly starts every fight with at least 50% Max Energy if she is below 50% when combat starts.Firefly's Skill consumes 40% Max HP to deal up to 200% ATK to a single target, and recovers up to 60% Max Energy on use. If there's not enough HP, the HP is set to 1. Using this Skill will also Action Advance Firefly by 25%. This is why the aforementioned 240 Energy cost of the Ultimate is less relevant, as it will always take at most 2 Skill uses to regain Firefly's Ultimate, and with the Action Advance she can further expedite the process of getting back into her Complete Combustion state.While she is in the Complete Combustion state, this Skill is Enhanced. It will now restore 25% Max HP on use, and will apply Fire Weakness to the primary target. It becomes a Blast AoE, dealing... Oh, huh. (0.2 x Break Effect + 200% ATK) to the primary target, and half of this to adjacent targets. The Break Effect taken into account for this attack caps at 360%.Okay, this is the point at which I have to remind you that Firefly is an entirely Break-focused unit with no inherent CRIT scaling in her kit - you\u2019re hitting for peanuts before an enemy is Broken. Samfly is designed to take advantage of the Weakness Broken state by dealing Super Break DMG, stacking a lot of SPD and Break Effect to maximize the damage you can deal and speed up the process of Breaking foes again. The immense bonuses she gets from her kit make her expertly suited for the task of abusing Broken foes, especially with the guaranteed Fire Implant on her Enhanced Skill, as well as the ATK conversion Bonus Trace.We'll skip ahead to her Bonus Traces since it's relevant to illustrate her Break focus. Her A2 will allow SAM in Complete Combustion to deal 55% of the original Toughness damage to enemies that are not weak to Fire. This is not always useful since her Enhanced Skill Implants Fire Weakness, but it will affect the adjacent that don't get Implanted. The A4 states that while SAM is in the Complete Combustion state with 200%/360% Break Effect or more, attacking a Broken enemy will convert the Toughness reducing damage of this into a single instance of 35%/50% Super Break DMG. The A6 also has a stat conversion, turning every 10 points of ATK beyond 1800 into an extra 0.8% Break Effect.So what does all this mean? Samfly is designed to take advantage of the Weakness Broken state by dealing Super Break DMG, stacking a lot of SPD and Break Effect to maximize the damage you can deal and speed up the process of Breaking foes again. The immense bonuses she gets from her kit make her expertly suited for the task of abusing Broken foes, especially with the guaranteed Fire Implant on her Enhanced Skill, as well as the ATK conversion Bonus Trace.Here's the primary issue: Firefly's intrinsic Super Break is not that strong on its own. It sounds like it'd be quite strong but it's surprisingly weaker than her kit would imply. This is exacerbated by the completely fake damage her upfront multipliers give because, as mentioned before, she is an entirely Break-focused unit. She can very quickly and easily get enemies Broken, but she appreciates some assistance to continue the decimation after they're already Broken. This means Firefly needs her emotional support raccoon, the Harmony Trailblazer. The immense amount of Break Effect that the Harmony Trailblazer grants alongside the Super Break provided by the Backup Dancer effect is exactly what Firefly needs to destroy enemies. The Super Break from both characters are two separate instances, so it results in a lot of damage after enemies are Broken. The Trailblazer's A6 also results in enemies getting delayed further after allies Break them, giving even more time to deal Super Break.This is the only truly non-negotiable teammate for Firefly. The difference with and without Harmony MC is staggering, like, Firefly is not the same character without the Trailblazer by her side. To better illustrate this, Firefly\u2019s Super Break is at 50%, while Harmony MC\u2019s Super Break can be as high as 160%. It\u2019s genuinely not close.The upside is that everyone has the Harmony Trailblazer, so as far as being tied to a single support character goes, it could be much worse. They provide everything that Firefly wants and also contributes a significant amount of both Toughness damage and Super Break damage of their own.In terms of sustain characters, it's also fairly cut and dry as it's just shrimply the best to bring Gallagher, for all the usual reasons: great sustain, very sp positive, and massive Toughness damage and bonus team Break damage. That last point is particularly relevant as Firefly is constantly Implanting Fire Weakness onto enemies, meaning Gallagher is also able to exert his full power at every turn. Gallagher does a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of regaining SP for Firefly, so it\u2019s a big difference if you don\u2019t have him.You do have other options if Gallagher is occupied by another team or if you don't have him; the usual suite of premium sustains are always good, though due to Firefly's rather exorbitant SP spending, I'd recommend going for the fully SP positive sustain options.For the last teammate slot, you do have options, but the obvious best choice is Ruan Mei. She is the best choice for this slot. Granting Firefly even more SPD, even more Weakness Break Efficiency, and RES PEN on top of all of that results in the team dishing out frankly absurd damage. Thanatoplum keeps enemies Broken for longer as well, and Weakness Break Efficiency acts as a multiplier on the damage of Super Break. Do note that Ruan Mei's and Firefly's Weakness Break Efficiency bonuses are additive with each other, but it's still extremely potent.To give some context on the other options for this team slot, there are two other issues that Firefly has at base; the first is that she is extraordinarily fast with additional Action Advance to boot, making her consume substantially more SP than you may be expecting. Ruan Mei is not massively SP-positive, but the damage she provides makes it worth the extra hassle. You really have to carefully consider your SP economy, or you'll end up in a terrible spot without being able to continue your offence right as the enemy gets Broken, leading to a colossal loss of damage.The second issue is that Firefly's Weakness Implant may make an enemy weak to Fire, but it does not apply the associated RES Down that comes with natural Elemental Weaknesses, meaning if an enemy is highly resistant to Fire, even if they're now taking Toughness damage, they'll still end up reducing Firefly's Super Break DMG once they're Broken; if an enemy has 60% RES to Fire, Implanting Fire Weakness with Firefly will not really do much to alleviate the issue, but Ruan Mei\u2019s RES PEN can greatly assist with this.To that end, if you do not have Ruan Mei available for the team, the next best choices are the classic debuffing supports of Pela and Silver Wolf. They\u2019re both definitively worse than Ruan Mei, but they are passable alternatives. Both of them provide massive DEF Shred which vastly improves the damage of Super Break and can also alleviate the natural Resistances of an enemy if you are trying to use Firefly to brute force content, and both of them are relatively SP positive, allowing Firefly to stay on the offensive for much longer. In addition to that, since they debuff the enemies, it's not possible for SAM to outspeed the benefits these actions provide.Some supports that don't really work as well would be Bronya and Asta, primarily because they're too SP hungry and their buffs disappear in a flash on SAM. To illustrate this point, there is a certain SPD breakpoint that SAM can reach to act an extra time in the Complete Combustion state, and it's around 210 SPD. That's... quite a ridiculous amount of SPD, and it does need a certain amount of investment to reach, but with that kind of frequency of attacking, any buffs applied directly to SAM will vanish before you know it, making it largely redundant to even try it. If you are a completely, absolutely new player without access to anything else, Asta may be used, but please endeavour to replace her with at least Pela as soon as you can, it is night and day.There aren't that many dedicated Break supports at the moment, so the optimal setup for Firefly at this point in time is extremely specific and inflexible, with the only team slot that does have some flexibility being limited to 3 of the most highly coveted support characters in the game. It is not that easy to substitute characters beyond that point, and results in a steep drop off in damage and ease of play. That said, Firefly's kit is so overloaded with fantastic free effects that any new characters that can facilitate this Super Break playstyle will mesh extremely well with what SAM can do.I've left Eidolons for last, because as usual I don't think they're necessary, but Firefly in particular has a very appealing set for people looking to vertically invest. E1 is the one to go for; when using the Enhanced Skill, the DMG dealt ignores 15% DEF, and more importantly, the Enhanced Skill will no longer consume Skill Points. This alone opens up the possibility for far more SP-heavy support characters like Bronya, and makes it that much easier to reach 100% DEF reduction with the right setups. E2 is also extremely impressive, making it so that whenever an enemy is defeated or Broken while under Complete Combustion, SAM gets an Extra Turn, with a 1-turn cooldown between triggering this effect. Basically, you get Seele's Resurgence but without the need to worry about SP (since you're already past E1 at this stage).E3, E4, and E5 are largely filler on the way to E6 (though E4's 50% Effect RES is quite nice). E6 grants SAM 20% Fire RES PEN under Complete Combustion, and provides an additional 50% Weakness Break Efficiency when using either Enhanced attack, for a new total of 100% Weakness Break Efficiency, literally doubling the Toughness damage of the attacks. This is arguably not as impressive as the likes of Acheron E6 or Boothill E6, but factoring in what you got along the way, SAM is basically completely unstoppable at this point.Light Cone options are also surprisingly cut and dry this time around, as there's only really one choice for you if you're not going for her signature, and that's On the Fall of an Aeon. It just gives her everything that she needs and is completely free for everyone, the only downside is that it's hotly contested so you may need to yoink it from another Destruction character if you want to have the best on Firefly.The conversation surrounding the choice between E1 and S1 is always tricky because it's really ultimately up to the individual player. Both choices are very good with both providing a great amount of benefit to Firefly. S1 is easier to go for because the odds of pulling it are higher, but for Firefly, E1 is probably the stronger choice overall albeit more expensive on average. By no means do you need either, and we're not evaluating her with these in consideration, it's just for the devoted few. As always 'make a choice you know you won't regret' etc etc, you know the drill by now.Actually, if you don\u2019t already have Ruan Mei, get Ruan Mei. She\u2019s getting rerun with Firefly so do yourself a favour, like actually, real.With Firefly's release, we've had back to back to back-banger characters, able to tackle pretty much everything in the game without reprieve. This is one of the best characters to go for and have on hand because, like with Acheron and Boothill, it's borderline impossible to stop Firefly from eviscerating everything. Enemy without Fire Weakness? No problem at all, here's a Fire Weakness. Enemy with really high Fire RES? Ruan Mei sends her regards. Multiple Break bars and shared HP pools? Firefly missed the part where that's her problem.It would take enemies permanently locking their Toughness bars or having full immunity to Fire for Firefly to be completely put out of commission, and that's unlikely to happen because it'd affect almost every other DPS character as well. This coupled with the fact that Firefly's kit is extremely easy to scale with future characters, and this may well be one of the best characters to invest in in the entire game.She truly will set the seas ablaze."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - HP >>> DEF%HP% is preferred on Fu Xuan but in order to be durable enough she needs enough DEF to mitigate incoming damage she takes herself but also from apportion. If you already have high HP and or need more DEF in order to balance out your stats you can use a DEF % chest instead. It is not recommended to use more than 1 DEF% main stat and with good gear and DEFe sub stats you'd ideally run 0.Feet - Speed >= HP%SPD in endgame will be Fu Xuan's best stat on boots - hitting specific speed breakpoints for MoC and moving faster in tough content like Swarm Disaster grants substantially more ultimates, break and a few more Skill Points all of which are incredibly strong.HP% is also an excellent choice especially before your Fu Xuan has insane gear - having more Speed isn't going to help if she is constantly dying. If you're struggling with survival or you need to increase the HP buff for your teammates from Fu Xuan's Matrix consider HP% boots instead.Planar Sphere - HP >>> DEF%Similar to the chest HP% is preferred but if you need DEF to tank up some more then you can use a DEF% sphere instead. It is not recommended to use more than 1 DEF% main stat and with good gear and DEFe sub stats you'd ideally run 0. Link Rope - Energy Regen >>> HP% > DEF%Fu Xuan does not generate much energy and her ultimate is quite expensive so Energy Regen rope improves her ability to access her ultimate substantially and will allow you to more easily keep her alive thanks to maintaining more charges of her talent to heal her up when she gets low. If you don't have a gold Energy Regen rope you can use HP% or DEF% in the meantime to make up for having access to fewer ultimates.Additional notes for StatsSpeed is desirable but not mandatory on Fu Xuan. The primary purpose of building Speed is to supply her with more frequent ultimates to grant her charges of her talent and spot heal the team with her traces. After your Fu Xuan is sufficiently tanky aim for the following Speed breakpoints (it will benefit you in Memory of Chaos but also other content like Simulated Universe and Swarm Disaster):100 Speed (Base) = No bonus actions,121 Speed = Bonus action on the 2nd cycle of every new wave,134 Speed = Bonus action on the 1st and 4th cycle of every new wave.More Speed can be built but picking up other stats is potentially more beneficial for Fu Xuan as she is not a fully SP positive unit and she only needs enough ultimates to keep herself and the team alive - more HP% or a stat of your choice is could be preferred.Total HP is what keep your Fu Xuan alive and also scales all of her abilities and party buffs/healing so it is by far her most important stat. In endgame when challenging difficult Simulated Universe content or Memory of Chaos 9-10 aim for your Fu Xuan to have 6500-8000 HP with her Matrix active.DEF is crucial for ensuring your Fu Xuan survives hits from enemies but also the damage apported from her allies while the Matrix is active. Without it she will die to large area of effect attacks. Aim for 1400-1600 DEF, if you need to swap out an HP% or SPD main stat piece to get your DEF up!"

Recommended for players who are missing Speed sub stats on the rest of their gear but want to hit the 121 or 134 speed MoC breakpoints for extra ultimates, break and SP generation.Guard of Wuthering Snow + Messenger Traversing HackerspaceCombines the great damage mitigation of Wuthering Snow with the Speed quality of life from Hackerspace. It's a very effective combination but lacks the HP scaling that benefits Fu Xuan and her team - still a very good option if you have access to good pieces to form the set.Longevous DiscipleBest set up for getting a bit more damage on Fu Xuan in most scenarios. The 16% crit rate buff from the 4-piece easily has 100% uptime and stacks very quickly thanks to her kit.

            "formatted": "Fu Xuan is a superb defensive support. Boasting the highest base HP value in the game, she provides teamwide damage reduction from her Talent at all times, and 65% damage redirection from her Skill, meaning that 65% of the damage an ally takes will instead be taken by Fu Xuan. She is able to restore HP with her Ultimate and also provides Max HP and CRIT Rate bonuses from her Skill. She even protects the whole team from crowd control debuffs. Altogether this makes Fu Xuan a fantastic and near universally applicable unit.The head of the Luofu\u2019s Divination Commission and Qingque\u2019s boss, Fu Xuan is a confident and compelling character. Fu Xuan is capable of greatly reducing the team\u2019s total damage taken and can significantly reduce the need for a second defensive unit, potentially eliminating the need altogether due to the strength of her own kit.Fu Xuan accomplishes this through multiple avenues. Her Talent provides a teamwide buff that grants everyone damage reduction, up to 18% at max Trace level. There is no prerequisite for this to be active beyond \u2018have Fu Xuan be alive\u2019. Damage reduction is a very underestimated stat in general\u2014even the small 8% provided by the Guard of Wuthering Snow Relic set is significant after even only a couple of cycles, so to have a permanently active 18% courtesy of Fu Xuan\u2019s Talent is extraordinarily powerful. Her Talent also has an interaction with her Ultimate, but we\u2019ll get to that.Fu Xuan\u2019s Skill applies a buff called Matrix of Prescience, which we\u2019ll naturally refer to as \u2018Matrix\u2019 from now on. The Matrix lasts for 3 turns and redirects 65% of all damage other allies take towards Fu Xuan, and this is before factoring in any shields. This means allies only take 35% of the intended damage, turning previously lethal hits into laughable ones. Factoring in the damage reduction from Fu Xuan\u2019s Talent, this reduces the damage even further still. As an added benefit to this, Matrix will also provide up to a 6% Max HP increase as well as a 12% CRIT Rate increase at max Trace level, further reducing effective damage taken, and even providing some offensive value to the team.\u00a0It is important at this point to mention that Fu Xuan\u2019s Basic ATK and Ultimate deal damage based on Fu Xuan\u2019s Max HP, meaning she is a pure HP-scaling unit. Coupled with her having the highest base HP value in the game, it makes it very easy to get to ridiculous HP values that even Blade would be amazed at. The player is further incentivized to go all in on HP due to the damage redirection provided by Matrix, because the unprepared Fu Xuan may find herself suddenly taking a massive AoE hit three times more than she ordinarily would have. Having said that, being able to contribute very meaningful damage in addition to all her other benefits makes Lady Fu an even more powerful addition to your team.Fu Xuan\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 100% of her Max HP to all enemies, and obtains 1 trigger count for her Talent. As a part of her Talent, she also has a special self-heal that will automatically activate if she falls to or below 50% of her Max HP, and will restore up to 90% of the HP she is missing. This won\u2019t overheal you, and won\u2019t activate if Fu Xuan suffers a killing blow. She has 1 trigger count for this effect by default, and can possess a maximum of 2, and the way to regain these is through the use of her Ultimate. It should be noted that Fu Xuan\u2019s Ultimate has an above average Energy cost of 135, meaning it\u2019s important to manage her abilities in a way where you can get this often enough to ensure both your team\u2019s and Fu Xuan\u2019s combined safety.Her Bonus Traces improve upon her Skill and Ultimate in exceptional ways. A2 will provide Fu Xuan with an extra 20 Energy if she uses her Skill while Matrix is still active, resulting in a huge influx of Energy for free by just refreshing Matrix when you would have been doing so anyway, and making it far easier to get more frequent uses of her Ultimate. Her A4 gives her Ultimate a small AoE heal when used, healing 5% of Fu Xuan\u2019s Max HP plus 133 to all other allies besides Fu Xuan herself. This is not a colossal heal by any stretch, but with the damage reduction and redirection Fu Xuan provides, it can potentially be significant enough to sustain the whole team on its own if Fu Xuan\u2019s Max HP is high enough. This also means that Fu Xuan demands a very high level of investment to be able to utilise as the solo defensive option for your team should you wish to do that, though with her offensive utilities and personal damage, using her alongside another defensive unit is still perfectly viable.Fu Xuan\u2019s A6 is of particular note as it will prevent Crowd Control debuffs from being applied to allies while the Matrix is active. This can happen once per Matrix usage and will be refreshed upon refreshing the Matrix. This means that for the turn that Crowd Control goes out, no ally will be affected by it under any circumstances for the current action. Examples include Decaying Shadow\u2019s Imprisoning spikes and Ice Out of Space\u2019s AoE Freezing attack. Since this does not prevent general debuffs such as DoT, this effect will not be erroneously wasted by such minor debuffs, making this a very efficient way of mitigating dangerous AoE Crowd Control effects, or even circumventing them entirely if they\u2019re infrequent enough that Matrix recasts can cover them.As you can see, Fu Xuan is already extraordinarily powerful on her own at E0. Her Eidolons are entirely unnecessary, and honestly not too noteworthy. E1 is probably the most meaningful upgrade, allowing her Matrix of Prescience to additionally provide 30% CRIT DMG. Fu Xuan is already somewhat consolidating defensive unit with offensive Harmony support, and this Eidolon fully leans into that. E2 essentially provides Fu Xuan\u2019s Matrix with Bailu\u2019s entire revive portion of her Talent; allies killed while Matrix is active will not fall and will regain 70% of their Max HP, and this can happen once per fight. The other Eidolons are not really worth chasing as they do not significantly improve Fu Xuan\u2019s performance beyond this point. E6 is obviously a big damage boost to her Ultimate but it\u2019s really there for flair and will not suddenly make Fu Xuan a damage-dealing menace comparable to dedicated damage options.There\u2019s not much more to say about Fu Xuan, she\u2019s really powerful and quite self-contained. However, I will mention that Fu Xuan is also extremely flexible with how you utilise her in combat. Ideally, Fu Xuan is SP positive since she only needs to use her Skill every 2 turns to benefit from the extra Energy from her A2, but there\u2019s nothing to stop you from refreshing her Matrix even earlier if you have the SP to spare. Doing so will give even more Energy and allow you to Ultimate more frequently, or maybe you decide you need her Ultimate this very turn. Perhaps you feel you need to refresh the Crowd Control immunity before the enemy\u2019s next turn. There\u2019s a lot of flexibility in terms of her SP usage, and it\u2019s up to the runner to notice if they have the SP to spare. Fu Xuan\u2019s skill ceiling is therefore quite high, and as one gets more comfortable using her, one will notice just how powerful she truly is.Lady Fu is formidable, and usable on pretty much every team. Her strong defensive utility coupled with her offensive benefits and decent personal damage make her a wonderful pairing with almost every damage dealer in the game. She sees all, and it is up to you to decide what you will do with her information"

            "formatted": "Gallagher is a unique offensive healer, applying a debuff to enemies through\u00a0his Ultimate that allows allies to heal by attacking them. His healing output trades stat scaling for very high base values, giving him far more build freedom and variety. He also increases the Break DMG that enemies receive and will receive bonuses to his Outgoing Healing by building Break Effect. He is the first sustain unit to be able to apply debuffs to enemies naturally, and has great debuff synergy.Definitely not traumatised security man Gallagher is here to offer you a cold soda. Should you choose to accept, you\u2019re gonna have a pretty solid healer on your hands who doubles as a fairly good breaker. He\u2019s got some intriguing mechanics similar to what Luocha provides, and is actually quite likely to fly under the radar as an unexpectedly competent character.Gallagher\u2019s main thing is that all of his healing is purely flat; there is no scaling component present, meaning any healing listed in his abilities is what you get, though it will still be affected by Outgoing Healing Boosts. This may initially seem like a heavy downside to have for a character designed primarily for healing, but he has ways of circumventing the lack of explicit scaling, and the far more interesting benefit of this is that Gallagher gets to build pretty much however he wants to and his healing will not suffer as a result.His Skill targets a single ally and heals them for up to 1600 HP. Yep, that\u2019s it. But hey, 1600 HP is not a small amount, it\u2019s pretty frequently around 50% Max HP for DPS characters, and keep in mind that this is before any bonuses to Outgoing Healing, so this actually becomes a very potent heal once you\u2019ve got some even lacklustre relics. The downside is that it doesn\u2019t do anything else, meaning you won\u2019t get any additional healing over time or a cleanse.Gallagher\u2019s Ultimate hits all enemies on the field, inflicting the Besotted debuff on them and dealing up to 150% ATK to enemies hit. This debuff is not tied to Effect Hit Rate and will always be applied, making it very consistent. This Ultimate will also Enhance Gallagher\u2019s next Basic ATK to Nectar Blitz.\u00a0Both the Enhanced Basic and the Besotted state are tied to his Talent. The Besotted state will increase the Break DMG that afflicted enemies will receive by up to 12%, and any time a Besotted enemy is attacked by an ally, the attacker will have their HP restored by up to 640 HP. The Enhanced Basic Nectar Blitz will deal up to 250% ATK to a single enemy and reduces their ATK by up to 15% for 2 turns, scaling with Basic ATK Trace level.You can see how Besotted is very similar in function to what Luocha\u2019s Abyss Flower provides, healing allies for simply attacking foes. It\u2019s a little less forgiving than Luocha, since Luocha has virtually no effort maintaining his Abyss Flower field due to the emergency healing passive on his Skill, and Gallagher actually has a slightly higher Energy cost on his Ultimate of 110. Additionally, since this healing is tied to a debuff, it puts the onus on Gallagher to be fast enough to keep up with enemies\u2019 SPD, as overly fast enemies will shed the Besotted state quite quickly.The tradeoff for this is that Besotted also has the offensive component of the increased Break DMG received. This is the first of its kind in Star Rail, as Break is notorious for being unaffected by anything besides the Break Effect stat. For the setups that excel in Break, this can turn already obscene Break damage into actual nuclear detonations \u2014 Luka absolutely sends his regards. Beyond the obvious synergies with specific Break characters, this also serves as a strong situational boost to the team\u2019s damage at no extra cost or effort.It\u2019s important to note as well that Nectar Blitz deals a whopping 90 Toughness damage by default, equivalent to most single-target Ultimates. Combining with the AoE 60 Toughness damage from his Ultimate, Gallagher can very quickly deal 150 Toughness to a single enemy, which is just unheard of for a sustain unit to be doing. Oh and the ATK reduction debuff Nectar Blitz applies is also exempt from the Effect Hit Rate checks, so it\u2019s also guaranteed, and a 15% reduction is nothing to scoff at, as it can very significantly reduce the overall incoming damage to the team in certain scenarios.The ironic downside of this is that if you Break the enemy with Gallagher\u2019s Ultimate as a means of delaying their Action, they\u2019ll end up recovering quicker than you\u2019d like and you\u2019ll get less time to take advantage of the Besotted state; to counteract this, if you\u2019re going to be using Gallagher\u2019s Ultimate to Break a powerful enemy and stop their Action, make sure to do it after their turn has already started so that you do not lose as much uptime on his Besotted state. You may have to take a hit first but it\u2019s the far better option than being stuck without Besotted for some turns.Gallagher\u2019s Bonus Traces are quite important for him to gain access to, as their effects are highly potent. His A2 will increase his own Outgoing Healing Boost by an amount equal to 50% of his Break Effect, up to a maximum bonus of 75% Outgoing Healing. This means he\u2019ll max this out at 150% Break Effect. Since his healing is completely flat, you can almost consider this to be the scaling component being re-added. Since calculating Outgoing Healing is really easy when there\u2019s only flat additional values in play, this is an as-listed multiplier to his healing.This ends up making his otherwise slightly uncomfortable healing over time from Besotted actually quite powerful and competitive; if you have the maximum bonus from his A2 and you also have an Outgoing Healing Boost chest piece equipped, Gallagher\u2019s healing is more than doubled, and he can reach values criminally close to Luocha\u2019s Abyss Flower. The downside remains that Besotted will only heal the attacker and doesn\u2019t have an AoE healing component like Abyss Flower.Of course, as mentioned before, Gallagher deals an astounding amount of Toughness damage all by himself, and the Besotted state with his A2 is now more than enough to sustain the team almost on its own, meaning Gallagher will also be using Basic ATK often to add onto the Toughness damage. Incentivising building Break Effect on him will have the additional result of making the Break he gets dealing a huge chunk of upfront damage \u2014 Fire is not the most amazing Break in the game as its ensuing Burn Damage over Time is not as impressive as other Breaks, but its immediate damage is among the highest, being joint first place with Physical Bleed\u2019s initial proc.Gallagher\u2019s A4 makes it so that he gets a 100% Action Advance upon using his Ultimate, meaning it is now his turn again. This is a ridiculously powerful tool to have available for the sustain unit in a team, since it means he can eke out extra actions where his SPD would simply not allow for ordinarily. When used carefully, this will also greatly alleviate the SPD needs of Gallagher and will allow him to keep up with foes much more easily, thus reducing the potential downtime of the now potent Besotted state. Since his Ultimate also grants him Nectar Blitz, this can allow for a very fast near on-demand 150 Toughness damage, making it quite good as a means to quickly Break a foe before a dangerous move.Do keep in mind, however, that Gallagher still requires a lot of SPD stats, as his Ultimate\u2019s cost is 110 and both forms of his Basic ATK only restore 20 Energy, meaning you will not be able to keep up with enemies in the endgame if your Gallagher is relying exclusively on this Bonus Trace to meet SPD thresholds.Finally, Gallagher\u2019s A6 will allow the Nectar Blitz he uses against Besotted enemies to apply the healing effect of his Talent to all allies for this attack, meaning he now has a potent AoE heal that he gets to use quite literally immediately after using his Ultimate to inflict the Besotted state on enemies. Coupled with his A4\u2019s 100% Action Advance, Gallagher now has a pretty good party-wide emergency heal available to him.As a 4-star character, it is likely to get Gallagher\u2019s Eidolons over time. They are not at all required for him to excel, but they do provide very notable benefits to what he was already doing well. E1 will immediately regenerate 20 Energy upon entering combat and will additionally increase Gallagher\u2019s Effect RES by a very impressive 50%. E2 will allow his Skill to cleanse a debuff from the targeted ally and will also increase their Effect RES by 30% for 2 turns. E4 extends the duration of the Besotted state by 1 turn, for a new maximum duration of 3 turns, and finally, E6 will increase Gallagher\u2019s Break Effect and Break Efficiency by 20% each.He is quite a formidable character. To be providing as much healing as he can do while still having great offensive utility is currently quite rare, especially so for a 4-star character. Additionally, because of his debuffing capabilities, he makes for a fantastic pairing with characters who rely on having enemies affected by them, such as Dr. Ratio and Acheron, and he even helps offset the requirement for a Relic set like Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters.He may not be quite as easy or intuitive to use as someone like Luocha or Lynx, but he\u2019s undeniably strong, and he\u2019s here to fight.Man really showed up and said, \u2018I\u2019m a healer, but\u2026\u2019"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Gepard is a capable Preservation sustain unit. He is a resilient tank that draws increased aggro from enemies passively and has very strong unconditional Shields from his Ultimate. He uniquely has a self-revive passive that allows him to recover once after being downed and will immediately restore his Energy to its maximum when it procs. Gepard also has some limited single-target Freeze utility with his Skill.Gepard is a unit whose value has fluctuated a fair bit over time but has landed on 'very decent'. He's got a lot more competition from all the sustain units released after him and this has led some to think he's no longer enough, but this isn't really true. Gepard's Shields are still very strong and funnily enough are starting to once again become more appreciated due to the large increases in damage from newer enemies.Shields and heals are largely interchangeable as a method of sustain as long as either can be maintained. The difference is that healing has more forgiveness if you make a mistake, while Shields are more forgiving against highly damaging foes; Shields can be thought of simply adding on a temporary health buffer to a character's existing HP bar, resulting in enemies dealing 'trash damage' \u2014 that is to say non meaningful damage, at least for as long as the damage doesn't spill over to the character's real health. Healing, however, can only work on whatever's not yet dead. Even lore-accurate Luocha isn't that good.As such, Gepard is one of very few units who can actually prevent the party from getting straight up one-shot by enemies, which is a highly coveted thing especially against enemies like True Sting or Kafka who can pull out an unreasonable amount of damage even if you are prepared for it. The only other unit who can do this as well is Fu Xuan, an absurdly powerful limited 5-star character, where Gepard is a far more accessible standard 5-star.Gepard's Ultimate applies these Shields to all allies, absorbing up to 45% DEF plus 600 for 3 turns. This has a meagre Energy cost of only 100 meaning it is quite possible to keep these Shields up indefinitely, assuming they're not being broken. The actual scaling of these Shields is actually slightly lower than March 7th's Skill's Shield but it is applied to all allies instead of just one and doesn't consume a Skill Point, leading to Gepard being a completely SP positive sustain unit unless you have a reason to use his Skill. Due to Gepard's higher base DEF, this difference is actually still usually in favour of Gepard.His Skill attacks a single enemy and deals up to 200% ATK to them and has a 65% base chance to Freeze the target for 1 turn. Frozen enemies will take 60% ATK upon unfreezing. While not likely to be dealing any significant damage, the option to spend a Skill Point on the chance to Freeze an enemy is actually quite underrated in my experience. Frozen enemies can't deal damage to you, and this is unsurprisingly a good thing.The counterpoint to this is 'neither can dead enemies' and, honestly, fair and true. Unless you're going for DoT team shenanigans with Freeze tech to squeeze out extra DoT ticks from enemies, it's highly likely that if you're using this Skill as a means of bolstering your team's survivability, you're already way out of your depth; Gepard's Shields are already strong enough to deal with most things in the game, but the few things they struggle with cannot currently be overcome with more investment.There's just a hard limit on how much DEF Gepard can actually stack and some enemies can still just pierce through them in a single powerful attack. At that point it is far better to fix your damage issue, because as before, a dead enemy cannot hurt you. Survivability is just as much about your damage dealers as it is about your sustain unit. It is no accident that many 0-cycle clears of Memory of Chaos do not even use sustain units, opting instead for a third support character.It may seem odd for me to mention this on Gepard's review specifically, but Gepard is an archetypal Shielder. He quite literally does not have the ability to heal allies, meaning any 'real' damage you take in a fight is permanent. If you can't keep up, you have entered a battle of attrition that you will inevitably lose, and it is in these situations that the power and investment of your other units will be tested to the extreme. This will remain true for Gepard as well as any future Preservation units who follow in these archetypal footsteps.There is a way to alleviate this somewhat. Gepard's Talent offers him a 1 time self-revive, restoring 50% of his Max HP. This Talent is also where all of his Bonus Traces congregate, and they need to be talked about together to get a full picture. A2 increases Gepard's likelihood of being attacked by enemies substantially, adding on to the already higher chance that Preservation units have, A6 will convert 35% of Gepard's current DEF to ATK, updating the value at the start of each turn, and A4 will restore 100% Energy to Gepard upon triggering the Talent.With this, Gepard is likely to be attacked a lot, sometimes enough to down him even through his very high DEF and strong Shields. Often this is accompanied by heavy AoE damage, and this is where the A4 can come in to save the day, allowing him to immediately recast his Ultimate, potentially just in time to save the rest of his team. If the Talent is triggering at all, you're already in a battle of attrition, but the important distinction now is that it may not be inherently doomed.Gepard's Eidolons are something that you may get over time as he is a standard 5-star unit. He doesn't really need them, but they expand upon his Freezing playstyle without interfering with his capabilities as a sustain unit. E1 in particular increases the base chance of his Skill's Freeze to apply by 35%, for a new total of 100% base chance. A little bit of Effect Hit Rate can make this surprisingly consistent against anything without additional Control RES, and can work wonders in highly specialised DoT teams.The only other thing Gepard has going against him is that newer sustain units do more than just sustain; Fu Xuan does his job almost to the letter but also increases the whole team's CRIT Rate, and Huohuo gives ATK% and Energy to the rest of the party too. It is not a stretch to say that this is likely going to be the norm moving forward, so Gepard will steadily lose value over time as newer sustain units perform his primary job but offer additional benefits.Even still, Gepard is a great character to have, and is definitely worth your time if you get him, especially since he's substantially better than your free options."

Feet - SPDBest choice for this slot.Planar Sphere - FIRE DMG % or ATK%%Both are viable options.Link Rope - ATK%%Best choice for this slot.Additional notes for sub-statsATK% & DMG%: Most of Guinaifen's damage is from her Burn. Stacking these two stats is the primary way to boost her damage. Seek them out wherever you can in equal amounts for the highest overall damage.Effect Hit Rate%: In order to land her Burn against all targets in the game Guinaifen needs 67% Effect Hit Rating total getting this will ensure she plays consistently. If you're playing against low-level enemies or want to gamble you can use less of this stat.Speed: A stat that doesn't boost Guinaifen's damage by much but does increase her consistency and supportive/break capabilities. Guinaifen's Burn only lasts 2 turns and some enemies can move incredibly fast - in order to ensure she can always keep all enemies Burned building some amount of Speed is needed. The breakpoint of 134 is usually sufficient but building more will ensure enemies always remain burned and she breaks more enemy fire toughness.HP% & DEF%: Defensive stats are needed on Guinaifen due to her low base stats and without them she is very likely to be 1 shot in endgame frequently. Pick up some HP% and DEF% on your relics or get used to having Guinaifen dye randomly.Energy Recharge: Guinaifen's Ultimate doesn't deal a large portion of her overall damage when played solo but does substantially more when used against Fire enemies that have been burned by Break effect or when combined with other Burn-focused characters. Building Energy Recharge is only recommended for those looking to ramp up Guinaifen's Firekiss debuff every so slightly faster or trigger an enemy's Burn or Break effect more frequently outside of these scenarios it results in a damage loss in most cases."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Guinaifen is an unexpectedly great support character. She afflicts enemies with a debuff that increases their total damage taken and can stack up to 3 times. She also deals a very impressive amount of damage over time (DoT) and can apply it very easily to many enemies at once. She can even be SP positive in 1 or 2 target scenarios, resulting in a near-universally applicable support character that also contributes very significant damage of her own. The cost of this is a very steep investment requirement, especially when compared to other support options.Guinaifen, Guinevere, or just Gwen. However you choose to call her, her charm is infectious and fiery, and her gameplay is equally explosive. As a DoT-based character, you may be led to believe that Gwen is predominantly made for Kafka teams and that she may not see much use elsewhere, but you would be quite mistaken.\u00a0Guinaifen\u2019s Talent is the source of her powerful debuff. While she is still alive and on the field, there is a 100% base chance to apply the Firekiss debuff to an enemy after they sustain damage from a Burn DoT. Firekiss will increase the damage that the target takes by up to 7%, stacking up to 3 times for a total of 21%.\u00a0Being able to inflict a 21% damage vulnerability is very strong. While damage taken is a slightly lesser debuff when compared to the likes of DEF Shred, it has the similar benefit of being very uncommon, meaning it often performs at its listed values due to not suffering from diminishing returns. Welt\u2019s 12% damage vulnerability debuff already gets high praise, and Gwen comes in slamming with 21%. What\u2019s more ridiculous is that Firekiss lasts for 3 turns, meaning this debuff is permanently active in practice. Even better is it\u2019s completely unremovable, so there\u2019s no possible way for enemies to get rid of it outside of its duration running out.Since her Talent requires a Burn DoT, it\u2019s only fitting that she can also apply one. Guinaifen\u2019s Skill will deal damage in a Blast AoE, up to 120% ATK to the main target and up to 40% to adjacent foes. This Skill has a 100% base chance to Burn all targets hits for 2 turns. Oh and the Burn DoT itself deals up to 218% of Gwen\u2019s ATK per tick. That is a very impressive damage multiplier to have in what is supposed to be a support character\u2019s kit. Having a 100% base chance also means that it\u2019s relatively easy to get enough Effect Hit Rate (EHR) to make this a guaranteed application on even the absolute pinnacle enemies you may encounter.Guinaifen\u2019s Ultimate deals damage to all enemies on the field, up to 120% ATK at max Trace level. If a target is afflicted with Burn, it will immediately deal damage equal to 92% of the Burn\u2019s original damage. Yeah, the thing that Kafka does for all DoT effects, Gwen can do that for all Burns. This significantly improves her already quite impressive personal damage. With this Ultimate having an average Energy cost of 120, this is going to be up pretty often. This also has the added benefit of stacking Firekiss even faster, thus reducing the required ramp-up time.\u00a0Guinaifen\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces raise her efficacy quite substantially. Her A2 will grant her Basic ATK an 80% base chance to inflict the same Burn DoT as the one from her Skill. While the base chance is slightly lower than on her Skill, this is what allows Gwen to be SP flexible, as she can range from SP neutral to even SP positive in 1 or 2 target scenarios as the majority of her damage comes from DoT. With this Bonus Ability, Gwen is able to contribute very significant damage while still restoring SP.Her A4 will Advance Forward Gwen\u2019s action by 25% at the beginning of the fight, which with a good amount of SPD will usually mean Gwen is one of the first people to act in a fight, if not the first. It\u2019s like having a weaker Vonwacq permanently without actually needing to use Vonwacq (this is the greatest trade deal in the history of trade deals).Gwen\u2019s A6 is particularly potent as it is exactly what Himeko has, causing Gwen to deal 20% increased damage to Burned enemies. This naturally also applies to the DoT effect she applies, and also stacks fully with her own damage vulnerability provided by Firekiss. Interesting to note as well is that Gwen is the first character to get Break Effect Minor Traces, getting a total of 24% Break Effect for free.Guinaifen absolutely does not need Eidolons to be strong, but as a 4-star character it is entirely possible to eventually get Eidolons for her. Of particular note is E1 and E6. E1 grants Skill a 100% base chance to reduce the attacked enemies\u2019 Effect RES by 10% for 2 turns, and E6 increases the maximum stacks of Firekiss to 4, meaning that by the time you get to this Eidolon level, Firekiss is going to be providing a 30.4% damage vulnerability.This character is just kind of nuts. While her debuff of damage vulnerability is technically less potent than DEF Shred, the fact that it\u2019s paired with exceptional personal damage more than offsets that difference. It\u2019s even got full uptime and is laughably easy to maintain. In fact, Guinaifen\u2019s personal damage output is arguably high enough that you could even reasonably put her into a hypercarry setup and see very impressive results.However, the cost of this power is the need for investment, and it is a particularly great need for Guinaifen. Usually support options like Pela only really need a little bit of one important stat to get going, sometimes not even needing to be at max level. Guinaifen can get by with the bare minimum just like the aforementioned characters, but she won\u2019t be able to compete with them at just that level, as she really wants to be built to deal damage as well.\u00a0She reaches a whole new level when you actually invest into her fully, and while this is something that is ultimately a very good investment, it is also something that not everybody can immediately afford to do. In addition to this, since Guinaifen does deal damage and especially because she is likely to be using Basic ATK a lot, she also requires pretty much all of her Traces to be levelled up to the maximum, which is yet more investment compared to her fellow debuffer.\u00a0Getting the required amount of EHR without sacrificing too much ATK% is actually quite difficult, and because of the need for such stats to begin with, Guinaifen can potentially be a little less safe when compared to support options that can afford to go for defensive stats. In practice, this should not be a particularly difficult thing to work around since Tingyun is one of the best supports already and has the same investment requirements and perceived squishiness, and Gwen has higher base stats than Tingyun does. If this is the supposed reason for your Gwen dying, that is most assuredly not the fault of Guinaifen.\u00a0Think of her as a long-term investment that will only get better as you get more things for her. She\u2019s worth the extra effort, even if it may not be immediately evident."

            "formatted": "One of the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. Of the four duties of a judge (detention, imprisonment, punishment, and interrogation), Hanya is charged with the last task.\nShe specializes in reading the karma and sins of criminals, and records their crimes and punishments with the Oracle Brush. As she spends her days using dreams to predict karmic offenses and has to endure the torrential flood of information regarding the mara-strucks' actions, she has long become dull to all things in the world. Only when she operates with her sister and fellow judge, Xueyi, will Hanya momentarily reveal her true nature."

If you are confident in keeping your Hanya's ultimate up without energy recharge though, Break Effect can be used for additional potential damage.Additional notes for sub-statsSPEED: Speed is by far Hanya's best stat and there is no limit to the amount you want on her. Increasing her own Speed improves her skill point generation for the team allowing for stronger team-building possibilities but also increases the potency and amount of Speed she is able to grant the target of her Ultimate further boosting their damage. As long as your Hanya has enough defensive stats to survive more Speed should always be the priority.HP% & DEF%: HP% and DEF% and mandartory in some amounts when playing Hanya in endgame as she has an incredibly low amount of base defensive stats. Additionally, Hanya's preferred top Light Cones are 4 or even 3 star Cones which have yet lower stats than usual leaving her dangerously vulnerable to getting one shot. Building defence on main stats and sub-stats saves her from being constantly taken down and allows her to perform her role correctly.EFFECT RES: An optional defensive stat that can allow for some easier fights but many of the strongest healers in the game now have protection from crowd-control or have an abundance of cleanses making this stat less needed on her. If you are using the Broken Keel planar set you will need enough Effect Res from sub-stats in order to activate its bonus.Energy Recharge: Energy recharge is essential for Hanya in order to gain access to her Ultimate quickly and keep it up on your target of choice for the majority of the fight. Using an Energy Rope in combination with an energy recharge Light Cone like Meshing of Cogs or Memories of the Past is recommended for optimal performance."

            "formatted": "Messenger Traversing Hackerspace4 Piece Hackerspace is by far the best supportive set for Hanya. It grants her additional Speed which she can transfer to the carry through her ultimate. The 4-piece bonus grants even more Speed on using her Ultimate but importantly grants the buff to herself as well - this occurs before her Ultimate calculates how much Speed to transfer to her target meaning that it allows for even larger Speed buffs for the carry.Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + Thief of Shooting MeteorGrants a Speed bonus and also Break Effect which can increase Hanya's damage contribution when played carefully against Physical vulnerable enemies.Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + Longevous DiscipleHas a good Speed bonus and also provides an HP bonus offering Hanya greater survivability.Musketeer of Wild WheatA reasonable alternative to gain a Speed bonus to Hackerspace pieces if you don't have any Hackerspace with good sub-stats but it is less powerful than all options above.Fleet of the AgelessBest generic supportive set for Hanya that can be used with all teams and also provides a nice defensive boost.Broken KeelA more powerful supportive set than Fleet of the Ageless but only when supporting CRIT-based characters. Also requires a small amount of Effect RES in order to activate the secondary bonus which will need to be acquired from sub-stats.Penacony, Land of DreamsThe energy generation from this set is not required but can sometimes allow Hanya to access her ultimate 1 turn earlier potentially improving uptime. The team buff from this set is also the strongest of the supportive sets but only works on Physical characters making it fairly niche.Sprightly VonwacqAn Energy Recharge option but worse than Penacony Land of Dreams in almost every situation."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Hanya is a powerful and versatile support buffer who provides universally appreciated benefits via a special effect, Burden (not a debuff). Allies who hit the Burdened enemy will gain increased damage for 2 turns and every 2 actions against the debuffed enemy will also restore 1 Skill Point for the team. The debuff lasts indefinitely until 2 Skill Points have been siphoned from the enemy. Her Ultimate is a strong single-target boost, increasing ATK and granting a SPD boost based on Hanya\u2019s own SPD. The envoy of the Ten Lords, Hanya is a first-of-its-kind Harmony support character, able to restore Skill Points for the team in addition to expected team buffing capabilities.Hanya\u2019s Skill is where the magic happens. She deals single-target damage to an enemy and applies a debuff to them. It is upon hitting this debuffed enemy that allies will gain benefits; any ally who attacks the debuffed enemy will gain a large DMG% increase for 2 turns, courtesy of Hanya\u2019s Talent. For every 2 attacks against the debuffed enemy, the team will also recover 1 SP. The debuff will only go away after the team has recovered 2 SP from its effect.It\u2019s important to note that this is somewhat irregular, as usually Harmony supports buff allies directly. By providing ally buffs through attacking a debuffed enemy, this offsets Hanya\u2019s buff application by a little bit, making it not as instantaneous to get it rolling. However, the tradeoff for this is that Hanya actually deals a hit against an enemy. Yes, it\u2019s not exactly going to be blowing anyone away with its insane damage output, but it does deal a Skill\u2019s worth of Toughness damage to an enemy, potentially providing a meaningful increase to the overall Breaking power of your team.The Skill Point recovery is also generally quite nice to have, but is massively game-changing for certain units who use a lot of SP at an expeditious rate, such as Imbibitor Lunae or Qingque. Perhaps less noticeable is how this extra free floating SP can be used to great benefit for the other support unit on a team; someone like Asta can make very good use of any extra SP lying around to maintain her strong ATK% buff more easily, as well as to generate more Energy for herself. There are so many support units who can benefit tremendously from the extra SP that Hanya provides, and the increase to overall comfort is definitely significant.Hanya\u2019s Ultimate targets a single ally and gives them a large ATK% increase, as well boosting their SPD by a percentage of Hanya\u2019s own SPD stat, and these buffs last for 2 turns. The ATK% increase is quite significant on its own, but the SPD bonus may be a bit misleading; Hanya obviously enjoys being quite speedy all on her own to have more overall Skill uses and increased SP recovery, but in order for the SPD boost that her Ultimate provides to be substantial, Hanya would need to reach rather high SPD values.However, this does also mean that if Hanya\u2019s own SPD changes in combat, it\u2019ll also have an effect on the SPD buff provided by her Ultimate, meaning that if she\u2019s getting any kind of speed boosts from outside sources, she could potentially be giving a mini Asta Ultimate to one teammate\u2014potentially even on top of an actual Asta Ultimate. Having said that, any sort of increase to a character\u2019s SPD is almost always appreciated, provided it doesn\u2019t ruin any specific speed tuning. The cost of this Ultimate is also rather steep, meaning it\u2019s not going to be up as often as other supports\u2019 Ultimates usually are.Hanya\u2019s Traces increase the potency of her benefits even more. Her A6 will grant Hanya 2 Energy when the SP recovery of her Skill is triggered, providing a small but potentially significant bump to Energy economy. Hanya\u2019s A4 will grant an additional Skill Point if the debuffed enemy dies after at least 1 SP has already been syphoned from them, and her A2 provides allies that trigger the SP recovery a minor ATK% increase for 1 turn. It\u2019s also useful to note that she also has a couple of SPD minor Traces, and is also tied for the 2nd highest Base SPD in the game at 110.When it comes to Eidolons, they are not necessary for Hanya to be a potent and universal team member, but as a 4* character it is likely to gain access to Eidolons over time. In particular is E1, which Action Advances Hanya whenever an ally buffed by her Ultimate defeats an enemy; though this can only happen once per turn, it helps Hanya to act even more frequently and thus feeds into her gameplan of SP recovery and teamwide buffing. E2 is much the same with the 1 turn SPD boost it provides. E4 and E6 increase the buffing power of her Ultimate and Talent respectively, and makes her even better at what she was already doing.Hanya is just really good and very consistent in what she does. Her team flexibility is almost unparalleled due to her being a very potent SP generator, and even plays very well with double damage dealer comps due to easy ally buffing through Burden. Not every team is going to need the extra SP Hanya provides, but there\u2019s very rarely a situation in which it is completely worthless, and her overall team utility is very high and very easy to access."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Herta is an AoE specialist character capable of dishing out surprisingly high damage against multiple combatants consistently. She has a low cost Ultimate and can very quickly regain Energy thanks to her Talent\u2019s follow-up attacks. She struggles significantly when there is only one enemy on the field, but can pivot to being SP positive in dual carry setups when that happens. Many of her Eidolons are also freely available courtesy of the rewards from the Simulated Universe.Well, well, well, how the turns table. Not as much as for Qingque admittedly, but hey, we can\u2019t all suddenly be considered one of the best characters in the game, right? Herta may still be scorned by many for being underwhelming in single-target scenarios, but she\u2019s certainly started making a compelling case for using her in the now numerous multi-target combat encounters we\u2019ve been getting steadily more accustomed to.Herta\u2019s Skill hits all enemies on the field for up to 100% of her ATK. If the enemies\u2019 HP is 50% or higher, this attack also deals 20% increased DMG to said targets. A simple Skill but one that is quite efficient in those multi-target situations. The increased DMG% is also appreciated and helps to get enemies down to the necessary HP thresholds to activate Herta\u2019s Talent.Her Talent will cause Herta to do her signature follow-up spin attack whenever an ally\u2019s attack reduces an enemy\u2019s HP to 50% or below. She\u2019ll deal up to 40% ATK to all enemies. A paltry amount initially, but this is per spin, and if multiple enemies\u2019 HP falls below 50%, Herta will do an equivalent amount of spins. This is even dynamically updated, so if the first follow-up attack reduces a second enemy\u2019s HP to below 50%, Herta will automatically perform a second spin within the same follow-up. Herta will also get these spins even if the target dies beforehand.This means that it\u2019s possible for Herta to get 5 consecutive spins off in a single follow-up attack if 5 enemies fall below 50% either before the first spin or within the follow-up attack window. If this happens, Herta is doing 40% ATK damage to 5 enemies, meaning it\u2019s essentially a 200% ATK total\u2026 5 times. It\u2019s weird to think that Herta\u2019s follow-up can deal an equivalent 1000% ATK damage to 5 targets, but it really is that much, and it can be very visible if your Herta is actually well invested.Important to note as well that each individual spin will also give Herta back 5 Energy, meaning multiple spins can very easily give a huge amount of Energy back for her Ultimate. Each spin will also deal its own instance of Toughness damage, meaning that a fully spun Herta will deal 75 Toughness damage to all enemies on the field, potentially.Herta\u2019s Ultimate deals 200% ATK to all enemies. It deals increased Toughness damage as well, and has a below average Energy cost of 110. Since it is quite likely that Herta will be killing off smaller enemies with her wide ranging attacks, she\u2019ll be getting plenty of Energy from the kills as well as plenty more from her Talent\u2019s follow-up attacks.Herta is an archetypal Erudition unit in this game. She is perfectly tailored to AoE combat and does a really good job at it. Unfortunately when it comes to single-target combat, the differences are extremely stark. Without the potential to combo into her Talent, her damage will suffer tremendously. Worse still is that while her Talent has the potential to deal a huge chunk of damage, it\u2019s a one-time deal; once an enemy is below 50% HP, it\u2019s extremely rare for them to be able to recover that lost health unless they\u2019re a boss type enemy.It\u2019s complicated. In the event that a strong Elite or Boss is facing you by themselves, Herta will offer virtually nothing in that encounter. If she\u2019s your only damage dealer in that fight, then she will quite literally be near useless. However this starts to get flipped if said Elite or Boss is capable of summoning reinforcements. Now, if there are plenty of smaller foes for Herta to decimate and proc her Talent off of, the incidental damage from her follow-up spins can end up making up a large portion of the damage she would otherwise be missing, and then contributing to higher Ultimate uptime in the process.From this you should be able to see that Herta is quite a feast or famine type of unit. If the conditions are met for her to excel, she will do so handily, but otherwise can fall to the wayside. Now that there is a much higher prevalence of enemies that can summon reinforcements repeatedly, Herta can actually be brought into fights that she has absolutely no business being in usually, such as against the IPC Team Leader Elite, or better yet, the True Sting. Yeah, she has a very good time against those damned bugs if you\u2019ve invested in her.The pervasive question then is \u2018should you invest in Herta\u2019 and that can seem tricky to answer initially. I say \u2018initially\u2019 because a great many people seem to claim they do not have an Ice damage dealer, which is odd since Herta most definitely exists and is given to everyone unconditionally. Returns on investment may not appear as obviously as for other flashier characters, especially 5-stars, but they most definitely do come about.Herta\u2019s A2 increases the DMG boost of her Skill by an extra 25% when used against high HP targets, for a new total of 45%. This is a very noticeable bump to damage, especially as it can contribute to pushing enemies below 50% HP for her Talent follow-up or sometimes just outright killing smaller foes. A4 provides a 35% chance to resist Crowd Control, a small but welcome addition to ensure that Herta is more frequently ready to perform a follow-up after an ally\u2019s attack, though this usually comes into play more in dual carry setups. A6 will allow her Ultimate to deal 20% increased DMG to Frozen enemies, something that actually comes up a fair bit if there are enough enemies for a lot of follow-ups due to the increased Toughness damage output.Herta is not only a freely accessible character but one who also gains Eidolons for free as well. As of the time of writing this, everyone is able to get an E4 Herta for completing worlds in the Simulated Universe. As such, she\u2019s evaluated with this in mind.E1 gives extra functionality to her Basic ATK. When attacking enemies below 50% HP, she will deal an extra 40% ATK as damage, for a new total of 140%. This is a pretty big deal in terms of Basic ATKs as it deals increased damage while still recovering a Skill Point, though this is usually not as big of a deal outside of dual carry setups, and is not enough to offset her weaknesses in single-target combat. E2 provides a permanent CRIT Rate boost of 3% every time her Talent is triggered up to a max of 5 stacks. 15% free CRIT Rate for just doing what you were going to be doing is a very impressive bonus for anyone, especially for Herta in those multi-target encounters where it\u2019s easy to stack up.E4 increases the Talent follow-up DMG by 10%, and E6 will increase Herta\u2019s ATK by 25% for 1 turn after using her Ultimate. E3 and E5 are actually significant to her as they increase ability levels and can have a very noticeable impact due to her AoE-heavy nature; her Skill goes to 110% ATK per enemy, and her Talent goes to 43% per enemy.Really, the other big downside of Herta besides her fumbling in single-target combat is that her Base stats are really low. Her Base ATK is on the lower end when it comes to damage dealers, and her DEF and HP are much the same, making her quite a frail unit.\u00a0Even still, she is capable of decimating swathes of enemies if put in the right spot and if the player actually invests in her. I\u2019ve said that multiple times because it\u2019s absolutely true. It\u2019s a very uneven progression, I will admit. It\u2019ll seem like nothing\u2019s improving until suddenly \u2018oh hey, my Herta is doing damage now\u2019. Please trust me that that point does definitely exist. You can look up videos of Herta wrecking Memory of Chaos if you need more proof.\u00a0I\u2019ve been using Herta since the beginning and I\u2019ve not done her justice, especially in the first iteration of this review. Especially after my initial lapses concerning Qingque, I\u2019m making it a point to do due diligence, and I can safely say that Herta is worth your while, especially if you\u2019re lacking another Ice damage dealer.Just don\u2019t bring her against the Stormbringer, that Ice weakness is the biggest bait, I swear."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Himeko is a strong AoE damage dealer with access to out-of-turn follow-up attacks. She is particularly powerful against numerous weaker enemies, able to wipe these smaller foes from the field relatively easily, and her Ultimate also refunds Energy for every enemy it kills, making her very good in content with respawning enemies. She has a reliance on the team being able to Break the enemy fairly consistently to be able to launch her follow-up attack, and her single-target damage is not particularly impressive.Himeko has typically been a rather scorned unit for her not particularly powerful kit. However, with Pure Fiction now in the game, as well as plenty of enemies who summon reinforcements as well, Himeko has had new life breathed into her.Himeko\u2019s Talent is the focal point of her kit. When an enemy is inflicted with Weakness Break, Himeko gains 1 point of Charge, up to a max of 3. At 3 stacks, she will immediately launch a follow-up attack on all enemies, dealing up to 140% ATK and consuming all stacks. She starts the battle with 1 stack, and she will instantly gain 3 stacks whenever an Elite or Boss is Broken.Naturally, this puts Himeko in a position where Breaking is of the utmost importance to make full use of this Talent. The Talent itself can also accrue stacks of Charge but its Toughness damage is on the lower end at only 30 \u2014 the same as a standard Basic ATK. This also skews Himeko much more in favour of many smaller enemies as opposed to fewer tougher ones. Even though she immediately gets a follow-up attack upon an Elite or Boss getting Broken, it is challenging for Himeko to be the one to do that herself and it usually takes too long to do so, so it\u2019s not preferred to take her in pure single-target scenarios for this reason.Himeko\u2019s Skill is a Blast AoE dealing up to 200% ATK to the main foe and 80% ATK to adjacent. Initially it may seem strange that an Erudition unit with a primary focus on AoE has a Skill only capable of hitting 3 targets at once, but you must remember that as a Blast AoE, the primary enemy takes more Toughness damage than they would if it was a truly AoE Skill. Even still, it limits how much coverage Himeko can provide without her Talent and again puts more emphasis on said Talent.Her Ultimate is an AoE attack dealing up to 230% ATK to all enemies. For every enemy defeated by this Ultimate, Himeko regains 5 Energy. With an average Energy cost of 120, this Ultimate is already up fairly frequently, and any kills will further accelerate the acquisition of the next Ultimate.As you can see, Himeko is all in on the AoE playstyle, both to her benefit and her detriment; it makes her exceptionally powerful if the content and enemy lineup favour her kit, but it makes her damn near useless if things don\u2019t go your way. There\u2019s not really any overlap like with some other units.The biggest issue is the activation criteria for her follow-up. Needing enemies to be Broken in order to build up to the attack is kind of a tall ask for how little damage it ends up dealing. Worse still is that it means you have no choice but to match the Weaknesses of the enemies you\u2019re facing \u2014 yes you should ideally be doing this anyway, but usually the only unit for whom this truly matters on a team is the primary damage dealer. For Himeko, you ideally want every single teammate to be capable of dealing Toughness damage to more quickly gain Talent stacks and be able to launch more follow-ups outside of her turn.This causes an interesting dilemma where Himeko is stuck trying to accommodate her own kit and losing efficacy as an actual Erudition unit as a result of that. Her Skill being Blast is good for the Toughness damage, but is actually quite a bit worse as an actual AoE clearing tool, especially since you\u2019re going in with the assumption of decimating minor foes, meaning you\u2019re also losing out on Energy from kills you could otherwise gain. It\u2019s a little tricky but it\u2019s possible to account for these issues with proper team building.\u00a0Compared to a unit like Herta, Himeko is more favorably tailored to dealing with Fire-weak foes, but Herta is arguably far more generally applicable due to Herta\u2019s Skill being fully AoE and her Talent only needing the criteria of an enemy falling below 50% HP. Both units struggle in single-target scenarios, but without the Weakness Break restriction, it\u2019s a lot easier to slot Herta into a team to deal with respawning adds than it is to slot Himeko, generally speaking.Himeko\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces are somewhat underwhelming to be frank. A2 makes it so that any of Himeko\u2019s attacks have a 50% base chance to inflict Burn on the enemies hit for 2 turns, with the Burn itself dealing 30% ATK at the start of enemies\u2019 turns. A4 causes her Skill to deal 20% more DMG to Burned foes, and A6 increases her CRIT Rate by 15% as long as Himeko is at or above 80% Max HP.With the exception of the CRIT Rate, these are kinda awful, actually. A 50% base chance to burn is basically not going to happen ever against endgame enemies, even if you did absolutely turbo invest into Effect Hit Rate (which you absolutely should not). Even if it does land, it\u2019ll be doing a laughable 30% ATK damage which is just not even worth looking at. Really the Burn is there to enable the DMG bonus on her Skill, but again with such a pitiful chance to actually Burn the enemy, the only way you\u2019re consistently taking advantage of the A4 is if you have a teammate constantly reapplying Burn.I should reiterate at this point that Himeko is definitely very strong when it comes to dealing AoE damage, just that it comes with certain caveats that perhaps other units don\u2019t have. As long as you account for these caveats, you\u2019ll have no trouble destroying AoE content.Himeko pairs quite nicely in a sort of \u2018mono-Fire\u2019 setup involving Topaz, as they both play off of each others\u2019 strengths and help to cover their weaknesses as well, with Topaz being an extraordinarily powerful single-target damage dealer. The comparison with Herta definitely puts Herta a step above in my opinion, but you can absolutely play them together and just watch the fireworks fly \u2014 you may think you were playing manually but if those two really get going, you may be led to question that.Naturally, because of the focus on Break, Ruan Mei is also unquestionably the best support to put with Himeko if you\u2019re seeking to get the most out of her kit. Dual carry setups with Himeko are also possible, but you would similarly need to make sure that whatever support character you choose is capable of buffing both damage characters at the same time, such as Asta or once again, Ruan Mei.As a standard 5-star character, it\u2019s possible to get Eidolons for Himeko over time. The performance boost that Himeko gets is not particularly noteworthy, and Himeko is fully functional at E0. Each Eidolon is a small overall boost but none of them are really worth chasing specifically.She\u2019s good. Pure Fiction definitely gave Himeko a much needed glow-up, but really she was just waiting for the right time. Definitely far from the worst character to lose your 50/50 to."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Hook is a mostly single-target focused damage dealer with some occasional Blast AoE thrown in. She is focused on inflicting Burn on enemies and then dealing increased damage against them, while also recovering some HP for herself and even regenerating some extra Energy. Her infrequent AoE results in her being more of an honorary Hunt unit, rather than a fully fledged Destruction character.We\u2019ve got characters like Qingque that are \u2018Erudition\u2019 in point size 50 inverted commas, and then we\u2019ve got Hook who is \u2018Destruction question mark?\u2019 and doesn\u2019t really seem to be doing Destruction things as well as she probably should do. Even still, she\u2019s a decent damage dealer and a relatively accessible source of Fire DMG.Hook\u2019s Skill deals up to 240% ATK to a single enemy and has a 100% base chance to Burn them for 2 turns, with the Burn dealing 65% ATK at the start of each turn. This Skill has an Enhanced version after using her Ultimate that deals up to 280% ATK to a single enemy and 80% ATK to adjacent foes, with the same Burn chance and damage.Her Ultimate deals up to 400% ATK to a single enemy and Enhances her next Skill. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it does. Would have been nice for it to be AoE but at least it has a good damage multiplier. It also has an average Energy cost of 120 meaning it\u2019s up more than you\u2019d think, especially when factoring in Hook\u2019s Talent. Hook\u2019s Talent will deal additional Fire DMG of up to 100% ATK when Hook attacks a target afflicted with Burn, and will also regenerate 5 extra Energy.\u00a0With this, it\u2019s plain to see that Hook is really not that complicated of a character, perhaps even to her detriment in some regards. What I mean by this is that there\u2019s nothing to really optimise or play around with. Our collective galaxybrains are mostly useless here since Hook\u2019s kit really is just this simple. Her upsides and downsides are as presented, and that\u2019s a little unfortunate since it results in her potential being really quite low by comparison to other characters.There can be no new support character that is beneficial to Hook\u2019s performance without also always being better for other damage dealers. She\u2019s a competent dps, but with her being quote unquote \u2018Destruction\u2019 and more like a Hunt character, she naturally struggles in many of the scenarios we see in the endgame these days. If there\u2019s ever a Fire-weak Boss that needs to be pounded into the ground, then Pitch Dark Hook the Great will undoubtedly have a good time against them \u2014 provided they don\u2019t summon reinforcements all the time.\u00a0Hook\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces definitely help out quite a bit with her performance but are really equally as boring as the rest of her kit. A2 restores 5% Max HP to Hook whenever her Talent is triggered, A4 increases the chance to resist Crowd Control debuffs by 35%, and A6 will Action Advance Hook by 20% when using her Ultimate, and additionally restore an extra 5 Energy.It\u2019s a lot of extra Energy coming Hook\u2019s way for just playing the game as you normally would, and it definitely contributes a fair bit to even more frequent Ultimates, thus reducing the downtime on her only source of AoE in her Enhanced Skill. Especially if you include teammates like Tingyun or Huohuo with Hook, you can end up getting extraordinarily frequent Ultimates that are dealing 500% ATK with her Talent included. It\u2019s definitely nothing to scoff at, and Hook\u2019s base stats are also surprisingly good.With Eidolons, Hook\u2019s performance actually goes up a fair bit. E1 grants a 20% DMG bonus to her Enhanced Skill, and E2 extends the duration of her Skill\u2019s Burn by 1 turn. This leads to greatly increased consistency especially since you\u2019re not likely to be building for Effect Hit Rate on purpose on Hook. E4 continues the trend by having a 100% base chance to burn adjacent enemies whenever her Talent is triggered, and finally E6 caps things off with a 20% DMG bonus against Burned enemies.She\u2019s definitely one of the forgotten characters of this game, and it\u2019s a bit unfortunate because she\u2019s really not bad at all. It\u2019s just that there are plenty of characters that are better. If Hook was given out for free to players like Qingque or more recently Lynx, I think people would be much more likely to actually use her, especially since there aren\u2019t really many strong accessible Fire units, even more so early on. What, you\u2019re gonna bring Fire Trailblazer as your solo damage option to the endgame? Yeah, good luck with that, I literally tried that already buddy. I\u2019ll give you one guess as to how it turned out.If you\u2019re lacking a Fire option but are sitting by an unlevelled Hook with potentially even E6, I may even recommend using her until you get something better. You may even be pleasantly surprised by her performance."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - Healing Output > HP%Healing output provides the most healing potential. HP% can be used in the meantime but should always be replaced when possible.Feet - Speed > HP%SPD is a good stat on Huohuo and is preferred over a much easier-to-acquire stat HP%. HP% should only be used before getting suitable speed boots.Planar Sphere - HP%Best in slot.Link Rope - Energy Recharge% > HP%Energy Recharge is essential for ensuring that Huohuo can execute the 4-action SP positive rotation smoothly. It is always recommended to use an Energy Recharge rope. Even when using higher ER Light Cones and gear sets, Energy Recharge is still recommended as it can allow for a 3-action Ultimate instead of a 4-action depending on your team's composition and the enemy's attack pattern.Additional notes for sub-statsSPD and HP% both directly improve Huohuo's kit performance providing her with more healing, Ultimates, and in most cases, Skill Point generation - acquire these sub-stats as a priority. Effect resistance and DEF% are good secondary options but neither are required even for the hardest content in the game.SPEED: Speed allows Huohuo to complete her rotation faster generating more skill points and generating more ultimates which provide energy and an attack boost for the team. High speed means more energy recharge and higher uptime on the ATK% boost, but it's not quite as clear cut as on other characters as part of Huohuo's rotation is reliant on the team. Huohuo gains energy every time an ally moves while her talent is active and the faster she moves through her rotation the less actions her team will get compared to her lowering the total energy she'll get from this mechanic. If Huohuo moves way faster than the rest of your team her 4-action rotation can sometimes become a 5-action rotation unless you have suitable energy recharge on your build. This outcome only happens when there is a massive difference in Speed and can be fixed by causing Huohuo to take extra combat damage, building more speed on the team, or by building more Energy Recharge.HP%: Best stat outside of Speed to stack for Huohuo - will increase her total healing output and also her tankiness.EFFECT RES: A reasonable stat to pick up outside of Speed and HP% which doesn't provide any bonuses to Huohuo's kit but can smooth out her gameplay in tough endgame content where many debuffs can be present. This stat is a lower priority than on other supports and healers for Huohuo though as she has incredible access to universal cleanses on her skill and talent.DEF%: After all SPD and HP% sub-stats have been acquired defence can be looked for as a bonus to make Huohuo a little bit more tanky.Energy Recharge: Energy Recharge is essential for Huohuo and thankfully in most team compositions she can get away with a skill point positive 4-action rotation just using an Energy Recharge Rope. If you want to pursue the occasional 3-action rotation with Huo Huo or you find your Huo Huo sometimes missing 4-action ultimates you can pick up some extra energy recharge on a Light Cone and Relic Set if so desired but it shouldn't be needed."

Using this set will come at the cost of a small healing loss but for those interested in the buff it can be worth it. WARNING: 4P Hackerspace can ruin speed-tuned teams.Musketeer of Wild Wheat4P musket can be used as a generic last resort for the 4-piece Speed bonus but doesn't offer much else for Huo Huo - still at the very least will assist with speeding up her rotation.Fleet of The AgelessBest generic support set for Huohuo that also provides a decent healing boost thanks to the HP% bonus. Will fall behind other specialized sets under certain circumstances though.Broken KeelAn excellent supportive option for CRIT-based damage dealers - the set bonus is also easy to activate as Huo Huo has effect resistance traces.Penacony, Land of DreamsProvides Energy Recharge which can smooth out Huohuo 4 action-rotation especially if she's built fast and the rest of her team is slow. Also provides a big damage boost to allies of the same element (Wind) allowing it to compete as a supportive option with Broken Keel and Fleet of The Ageless but only for that element.Sprightly VonwacqAn Energy Recharge option but worse than Penacony Land of Dreams in almost every situation."

            "formatted": "Huohuo consolidates strong Abundance healing with Harmony support. She can restore 20% Max Energy to all other allies as well as buff their ATK by 40% for 2 turns with her Ultimate. Her Skill\u2019s healing is AoE by default, and her Talent provides a high degree of strong passive healing akin to Luocha with the added benefit of cleansing allies both when their turn starts or when they use an Ultimate. Huohuo must use SP to keep her Talent active, so she is not fully SP-positive like Luocha, but she is able to maintain SP neutrality very easily.The timid trainee Ten-Lords Judge, Huohuo, is another addition to the Path of Abundance. Though she occupies a somewhat ironic position in-universe given her scaredy-cat disposition, she has no issues whatsoever when it comes to sustaining your party, and even comes with a few very unique perks that could potentially make her a more desirable pickup.Huohuo\u2019s Skill will target an ally and restore their HP by up to 21% of Huohuo\u2019s Max HP plus 560. This is actually a Blast Heal that also heals adjacent allies for up to 16.8% of Huohuo\u2019s Max HP plus 448. Given that Huohuo is an HP-scaling scaler, this ends up being a colossal amount of healing to be given out upfront, and better yet is that it naturally includes a debuff dispel for the main ally.Her Skill is important to mention first because it ties into her verbose but powerful Talent. Huohuo gains Divine Provision for 2 turns after using her Skill. While Huohuo has Divine Provision, she is able to provide passive healing to allies at the start of their turn or when they use their Ultimate, restoring up to 4.5% of Huohuo\u2019s Max HP plus 120. When this healing is triggered, it will also cleanse a debuff from the ally who was healed. The cleanse effect has 6 uses before it needs to be reset by using Huohuo\u2019s Skill. Adding onto this, every ally who is below 50% Max HP will also be healed in addition to the ally whose turn or Ultimate it was, meaning this is also a fairly effective emergency healing tool.This is a very impressive amount of passive healing over time, and since it requires that Huohuo use her Skill to refresh the number of uses, her total healing output is astonishing, giving Luocha\u2019s Abyss Flower a run for its money. More impressive however is the amount of free cleansing that Huohuo gives out; many enemies have pesky Crowd Control debuffs that stop your allies in their tracks, but many more have more subtle but equally dangerous debuffs like Damage over Time (DoT) or DEF Reduction, and the other Abundance characters are often not able to deal with them in a quick enough fashion at the end game.Against debuff-heavy enemies, this creates a battle of attrition that realistically only Luocha is capable of outhealing consistently (when considering Abundance characters specifically). Huohuo is capable of getting close to that level of healing whilst also providing extremely frequent debuff dispels at virtually no additional cost, but the activation criteria is more restrictive since it specifically requires a turn or an Ultimate, rather than just dealing damage.Huohuo also follows in Fu Xuan\u2019s footsteps of challenging what it means to be a part of her respective path; just as Fu Xuan is able to provide offensive utility with her Matrix of Prescience, so too is Huohuo able to provide that with her Ultimate. Huohuo\u2019s Ultimate will regenerate up to 20% of all other allies\u2019 respective Max Energy and provide a 40% ATK boost for 2 turns. Having your sustain unit provide benefits more akin to that of a Harmony is impressive, and allows the opportunity to have more intriguing and experimental team compositions.There are a few things to note about this Ultimate; the Energy restoration portion is a nice addition to have but can often be inconsequential, as 20% of a character\u2019s Max Energy is usually anywhere between an extra Skill or Basic ATK\u2019s worth of Energy. This means that for the majority of damage dealers, this will not significantly shift the needle on when they get their Ultimates, but it can actually be quite useful for your other support characters. The other big thing is that this Ultimate has an Energy cost of 140, meaning it\u2019s not going to be up super frequently.Huohuo\u2019s first Bonus Ability Trace A2 lets her start with a 1-turn Divine Provision, giving her a head start on healing, and her A4 increases her Crowd Control RES by 35%. Huohuo\u2019s A6 is of particular note as it restores 1 Energy to her whenever her Talent is triggered to heal allies. This actually ends up being a very significant increase to her overall energy gains and helps offset her high Ultimate cost.Because of her costly Ultimate, Huohuo is not as straightforward to play as other healers if you wish to maximize the usefulness of her Ultimate\u2019s buffs. There are many factors at play to try and reach a consistent timing on her Ultimate, including having speedy allies to trigger Huohuo\u2019s Talent frequently and having Huohuo herself getting hit semi-consistently to get more Energy back that way. Specific Light Cone options and Energy Regen Ropes can also help reach this more easily and should probably be considered to ease the burden of maximizing her.Compared to Luocha, she\u2019s got a somewhat similar performance floor due to her high healing output, however, Luocha is significantly more SP positive. Comparing to Fu Xuan, Fu Xuan unsurprisingly has an edge due to being completely effortless in both her party sustain and her offensive utility, but if the player is prepared to work a little for Huohuo\u2019s buffs, it\u2019s possible to see similar benefits, and both characters use about the same amount of SP, with Huohuo maybe needing a little more at times.\u00a0Luocha, Fu Xuan, and now Huohuo. All three of these characters are veritable giants and their performance for the vast majority of people is too similar to significantly matter. The game is steadily getting more challenging for the average player, and owning even a single one of these characters is likely to make your life substantially less painful.If you already have a well-built Fu Xuan, Luocha, or even Gepard, it is unlikely that Huohuo will open up any new avenues for you. But if you do not already own at least one of these aforementioned characters, or if you\u2019re just really enamoured by her design, then you should at the very least consider going for Huohuo."

For low cycle performance and high damage output Speed (134) is our personal favorite and what gave us the best results - but at the same time it's the most restrictive in terms of teambuilding (also at E2 you may encounter some SP issues when running 134 Speed),Planar Sphere - Imaginary DMG > ATK%Link Rope - ATK%"

Also, it's a better choice for Speed-focused builds.Those two sets are the best for Imbibitor Lunae, but if you can't complete them, you can use various 2+2 combinations like: Wastelander of Banditry Desert + Musketeer of Wild Wheat, Wastelander of Banditry Desert + Messenger Traversing Hackerspace or Musketeer of Wild Wheat + Messenger Traversing Hackerspace."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Imbibitor Lunae is a supremely powerful damage dealer in both single-target and Blast scenarios. His upfront damage multipliers are unrivalled and he also deals vastly increased Toughness damage. Imbibitor Lunae has intrinsic DMG% and CRIT buffs as well, making him very self-sufficient in terms of damage output. The cost of this is up to 3 SP on every one of his turns, as well as a lot of forethought, careful gameplay, and quite demanding team management.Dan Heng\u2019s secret form, revealed at last. The majestic visage of his true Vidyadhara state brings with it hitherto unmatched damage output and a gameplay style reminiscent of that of Qingque. While Imbibitor Lunae does not need to roll the dice like Qingque does, much like Qingque he too can consume extra SP on his turn to substantially boost his own performance. The cost of this is equally similar, requiring a healthy and persistent flow of SP to him, and this can bring quite the headache to players who are not prepared for the foresight and strategy required to utilize Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s power to its fullest.Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Skill is where the fun is. Each use of his Skill will Enhance his Basic ATK, up to 3 times in total. At x1, his Enhanced Basic hits 3 times and deals 260% of his ATK to a single target. At x2, his Enhanced Basic hits 5 times and deals 380% to a single target, with the final two hits also dealing 60% to adjacent foes. Finally, at x3 his Enhanced Basic hits 7 times, dealing 500% to a single target, with the last four hits also dealing 180% to adjacent foes.Yes, you are reading that correctly. A x3 boosted Enhanced Basic deals up to 500% ATK at max Trace level, with 180% to adjacent targets, meaning that this one attack is dealing the equivalent of 860% ATK, and if you\u2019re able to hold onto enough SP between turns, Imbibitor Lunae can be casually dishing this out on every single one of his turns. Keeping this amount of SP available is difficult, but it\u2019s highly worthwhile since the damage increase per SP spent is very large, meaning that for every enhancement used, each SP used is also retroactively worth more.Important to note as well, each tier of Enhancement will also increase the amount of Energy and Toughness damage brought by each attack; x1 is 30 Energy and 60 Toughness, x2 is 35 Energy and 90 Toughness, and x3 is 40 Energy and a ridiculous 120 Toughness damage. That\u2019s the highest single instance of Toughness damage we\u2019ve yet seen. The extra Energy gains also mean that it\u2019s easier for Imbibitor Lunae to regain his high 140 cost Ultimate quickly.His Ultimate hits 3 times and deals up to 300% ATK to a single target and 140% to adjacent foes at max Trace level. His Ultimate then grants him 2 stacks of a buff called Squama Sacrosancta, and he can have up to 3 of these at any time. You can consume these in place of Skill Points when using Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Skill Enhancement, greatly reducing the strain on your team\u2019s SP for his next turn. Because of the increased Energy gain on Enhanced Basics, the more of them you can use, the faster you can regain his Ultimate to continue the cycle.\u00a0You may have noticed that I\u2019ve been mentioning how many hits each attack of his deals, and that has to do with Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Talent. He will gain 1 stack of Righteous Heart after each hit unleashed during an attack, meaning that the more hits an attack deals, the more stacks you will gain. This effect stacks up to 6 times and each stack grants up to 10% increased DMG at max Trace level, lasting until the end of his turn. His Skill also has an extra passive only for a x2 or x3 Enhanced Basic, where starting from the fourth hit onward, before every hit he will gain a stack of Outroar up to 4 stacks, with each stack increasing Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s CRIT DMG by up to 12% at max Skill Trace level. These also last until the end of his turn.What this ends up amounting to is a lot of extra damage entirely for free, and there\u2019s really no extra thought required for this. A minor optimization could be made if the situation arises where you can transfer these powerful buffs to Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Ultimate by using it after your Enhanced Basic but before the turn ends, much like how Qingque can transfer her Skill buffs to her Ultimate as well. However, because of the large Energy returns on Enhanced Basics, this should only be considered if using the Enhanced Basic will grant you enough Energy for the Ultimate on that turn.Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Bonus Traces provide passive benefits that just improve his performance; A2 grants 15 Energy upon entering battle, while A4 grants a significant 35% chance to resist Crowd Control debuffs. A6 makes Imbibitor Lunae even more adept at dispatching Imaginary weak foes, granting him a persistent 24% increased CRIT DMG when dealing damage to them.Because Imbibitor Lunae is already somewhat overkill for most things, his Eidolons are even more so unnecessary for him to be strong. E1 increases the maximum Talent stacks by 4, up to a new total of 10, and doubles the stacks gained per hit. E2 grants 1 extra Squama Sacrosancta for a new total of 3, and also advances his turn forward by 100%. This makes it so that he can instantly act again and get a full x3 Enhanced Basic for free, which is absolutely ridiculous. For spenders, this is the recommended stopping point, as neither E4 nor E6 have anywhere close to as much impact as E2 does.With this much power under his belt already, finding teammates for Imbibitor Lunae is as simple as enabling him to deal this damage as often as possible\u2026 with the added challenge of not taking away any of his owed SP. How this is achieved depends on how you choose to play him. If you\u2019re aiming to utilize his x3 Enhanced Basic on every single one of his turns (all-in), then you\u2019re going to need the other three teammates to be completely SP-positive (or have 2 SP-Positive and 1 SP-Neutral). For example, Tingyun and Luocha are considered as SP-positive characters because the first only uses her Skill every 3 turns and Luocha never needs to use his. Also, someone like Pela is fully SP positive unless you need her dispel effect, meaning she is a great pairing with Imbibitor Lunae, since she also provides AoE DEF shred with her Ultimate, though do note Pela will need to be very fast.Running an all-in Imbibitor Lunae is also quite difficult with other defensive units that aren\u2019t Gepard or Luocha; neither Gepard nor Luocha need to use SP to provide all of their defensive utility, but other defensive units like March, Natasha, or Bailu, all will need to be using their Skills every so often to ensure that they\u2019re actually providing their benefits, meaning it will also inevitably become unsustainable within an Imbibitor Lunae team.Conversely, you can play Imbibitor Lunae by only using his x3 Enhanced Basic every other turn, and regular Basic ATKs in between (alternating). This substantially lowers his SP requirements, especially when factoring in the \u2018free\u2019 Skill Point usage his Ultimate gives him, and this allows him to have more flexible team comps. Obviously, this method of playing him deals less damage than the former method, but it\u2019s far less SP and brain-intensive, and personal comfort is also a valid reason to switch things up. That said, this alternative playstyle still offers extremely competitive damage output when compared to other top damage dealers, so don\u2019t feel forced into using the all-in playstyle to see success.No damage dealer review is complete without mentioning Bronya, and it must be said that utilizing her with Imbibitor Lunae is inordinately challenging. Bronya naturally brings with her conversations about SPD tuning, and it all spirals from there. A super-fast Bronya will be able to provide a lot of value for Imbibitor Lunae because she will be able to generate a fair amount of SP as well, but she is far more usable on an alternating playstyle than on an all-in playstyle - in that playstyle, you make Bronya 1 Speed slower than Imbibitor Lunae, so she goes right after him and boost him with her Skill. You physically do not have the SP required to do a x3 Enhanced Basic into Bronya Skill into x3 Enhanced Basic, since that line would cost you 7 SP. This would only be possible with Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Ultimate and even then it would cost you all 5 of your team\u2019s SP. Would it completely mince whatever\u2019s in front of you? Absolutely, but it\u2019s just not practical.Yukong is also a remarkably powerful support option here, especially due to her A4 granting a permanent 12% Imaginary DMG boost to the team. Her CRIT buffs are undeniably powerful, but like Bronya, she is incapable of sustaining these benefits indefinitely onto an all-in Imbibitor Lunae. An alternating Imbibitor Lunae would allow Yukong more freedom to utilize her buffs without completely draining the SP tank in the process. However, the SPD issue is far more pronounced for Yukong than for Bronya, as Yukong does not have any natural Turn Advance in her kit, neither for herself nor allies. Using her with Imbibitor Lunae will demand very strict SPD tuning to ensure that Yukong is always acting at least 2 turns before Imbibitor Lunae does, else her presence is entirely wasted on that team. E6 for Yukong can significantly alleviate this issue, but even then it\u2019s still extremely difficult to use her.The final note is about Welt and the mono-Imaginary team. It\u2019s a fun team, potentially even good in some specific circumstances, but is also unfortunately unsustainable, as both Welt and Yukong also want to have as much Ultimate uptime as possible, which necessitates using their Skills for more Energy. Welt is potentially decent to use with Imbibitor Lunae for the purposes of activating the very potent 4pc effect of the Wastelander of Banditry relic set, as Imbibitor Lunae has no way of activating this on his own. Similar issues can arise as mentioned previously, and SP management is the name of the game. Since Welt can also be used as a competent damage dealer of his own, it\u2019s up to the player whether or not they\u2019re comfortable relegating him to a more support-oriented role.If you don\u2019t want to deal with all that hassle, just use Tingyun and Pela instead.Imbibitor Lunae might be an SP-consuming fiend, but his damage output and somewhat flexible playstyle make him extraordinarily powerful, and usable almost anywhere and against any foe. Where will the Trailblaze take him next, I wonder\u2026?"

To account for this ensure your CRIT Rate is as high as possible even if it seems your CRIT DMG is a little low outside of combat. A CRIT Ratio of 100% Crit Ratio to 100% Crit DMG is an acceptable ratio on Jade as it will quickly become 100:220%. Speed: Jade isn't overly reliant on her Speed as she deals most of her damage through her Follow-Up attacks which are fueled largely by the target of her Debt Collection. For this reason, Speed is optional on her - you can still invest into it allowing her to execute more Basic Attacks of her own, but it's also just as viable if not more so to pursue higher damage through more offensive stats such as ATK, CRIT Rate, and CRIT DMG.

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Jade is a competent Erudition damage dealer with some buffing capabilities and a focus on follow-up damage. Her Debt Collector buff will increase a single ally's SPD and let them deal additional Quantum DMG based on Jade's ATK. This status also drains a small bit of health from the buffed ally. She can deal large amounts of AoE damage and has a ramping self-buff that increases her CRIT DMG and ATK%. She relies very heavily on there being many enemies on the field to get stacks for her own follow-up, making her a powerful pick in those scenarios but unimpressive elsewhere.Our first actual Quantum Erudition unit. As the IPC executive who goes around offering Faustian deals left and right, it should come as no surprise that Jade also takes her dues when buffing an ally. She's a follow-up unit with a big focus on AoE, to the point where she is also the first-ever character to have a Blast AoE on an non-Enhanced Basic ATK.Jade's Skill will select a single ally to become a Debt Collector. This buff lasts for 3 of Jade's turns. While it's active, the Debt Collector gets a flat increase in SPD of 30 and all of their attacks deal a single additional instance of Quantum DMG based on Jade's ATK, up to 25%. The Debt Collector will also lose 2% Max HP each time they attack. Jade can use this buff on herself but it will not provide the SPD boost or HP drain. Jade also cannot recast this while it's active, meaning you will need to wait for it to drop fully before being able to reapply it.This is actually a pretty potent boost to a single character, especially that SPD boost. As the duration only goes down on Jade's turns and not the affected ally\u2019s, it heavily favours already fast-acting characters to make the most out of the buff before Jade needs to reapply it \u2014 and one of the best examples of this is follow-up attackers, since they\u2019re constantly acting out of turn.The HP drain is largely insignificant and the extra damage provided by the buff allows Jade to contribute a great deal in AoE scenarios against multiple foes. It won\u2019t be that great against single-target or even Blast AoE scenarios, so it really is catering towards Pure Fiction style content. This AoE focus is also why Jade's Basic ATK is a Blast AoE, being the first of its kind and also letting Jade act as an SP generator for the team while still playing into her gameplan, especially since she doesn\u2019t technically have a Skill.Jade's Talent is a Charge-based follow-up; when Jade or the Debt Collector attack enemies, Jade gains 1 point of Charge for every enemy hit. This only counts once for each enemy per attack, meaning if say Herta Debt Collector spins 5 times against 5 enemies, Jade will still only receive 5 Charge stacks. When Jade has at least 8 points of Charge, she will consume 8 points to launch a follow-up attack against all enemies, dealing up to 120% ATK. This follow-up can't grant stacks of Charge, so you are further incentivised to make someone other than Jade the Debt Collector, as ally follow-ups will grant Charge. It's also one of the highest Energy generating follow-ups in the game, giving Jade 10 points per follow-up, allowing for rather quick Ultimates.This Talent also has a secondary portion where each time she launches a follow-up attack, she gains stacks on a ramping self-buff called Pawned Asset, with each stack granting up to 2.4% Crit DMG, stacking up to 50 times. Each one of Jade's Talent follow-up attacks will grant her 5 stacks of Pawned Asset. This buff has no duration and will last for the remainder of the fight, providing a great deal of free offensive stats.Her Ultimate deals up to 240% ATK to all enemies and will provide an increase to Jade's follow-up multiplier of up to 80%, making the follow-up go from 120% ATK to 200% ATK, which is very strong for a non-Ultimate AoE attack. This Enhancement affects 2 of Jade's follow-ups before disappearing. This Ultimate has a fairly hefty cost of 140 Energy, but again because of the aforementioned Energy coming from her Talent's follow-up, as long as enemies are constantly getting hit and Jade is constantly using her follow-up, this Ultimate is going to be up fairly often.Jade's Bonus Ability Traces are also fairly simple. A2 will grant Jade 1 stack of Pawned Asset whenever an enemy target enters combat for the first time (including summons), and an additional 3 stacks of Pawned Asset whenever the Debt Collector's turn starts, again placing emphasis on speedy characters. A4 gives a 50% Action Advance to Jade at the start of combat, making it almost guaranteed that she will be the first person to act in a fight and allowing her to activate the Debt Collector buff before anyone else has a chance to act first. A6 will allow Pawned Asset to also provide an ATK boost, 0.5% ATK per stack.It should be clear that Jade is expertly tailored to handling AoE content where enemies are plentiful and are constantly reappearing \u2014 or in other words, Pure Fiction. She's got exceptional synergy with the usual PF destroyers, Herta and Himeko, as their follow-ups are frequent and fully AoE, letting them generate lots of Charge for Jade resulting in even more follow-ups. She doesn\u2019t really want to be paired with both at the same time as it\u2019s just unnecessary overkill, but by pairing Jade with either Herta or Himeko will allow the other to be sent to the other side without worry.She also has surprisingly impressive synergy with Blade, as he wants to be losing HP to get more frequent follow-ups of his own, and Jade's HP syphoning Debt Collector buff is exactly what the mara-struck ordered. With the Debt Collector buff, Blade will be able to gain 2 stacks towards his follow-up with every offensive action taken, greatly increasing the frequency of said follow-up. Since this follow-up heals Blade, it increases his ease of use beyond his usual, and more importantly, because the follow-up is also fully AoE, it feeds right back into Jade\u2019s kit perfectly. It\u2019s an astonishingly powerful combination.As such, Jade has plenty of team options when it comes to handling Pure Fiction, and is essentially a very easy way to clear the content with only some basic team planning; Herta, Himeko, Argenti, heck even Clara can work. As long as the assigned Debt Collector can hit multiple foes simultaneously and frequently, Jade's going to be getting and providing value.Here's where things get tricky, though. Jade is not a particularly complicated character in terms of her actual gameplay design, which is definitely a nice breath of fresh air after the mechanical maniacs we've been getting the past little while. It's definitely a good thing for players trying to just understand what she seeks to accomplish in combat, but it creates a dilemma for people who have been around for a while.This simplicity is a blessing and a curse, as it makes it easier to understand what Jade\u2019s after, but it comes with the caveat of being far more inflexible; what you see is what you get, and if you can\u2019t play into what she wants to be doing, then You\u2019re gonna have a bad time\u2122, and the crux of this is that all of Jade\u2019s power is locked behind what your allies are doing \u2014 how often are they attacking, what is their method of dealing damage, how fast are they, are they incapacitated or under Crowd Control right now, even what specific enemies you\u2019re facing.All of this culminates in a character whose damage output is so extremely inconsistent and variable that it\u2019s not always possible to predict how she\u2019ll perform, even in different runs of the same encounter. It can be quite a frustrating experience, and it\u2019s ironic that characters with entire dissertations for Ability descriptions are so significantly simpler to make full use of.Jade is a goddess in Pure Fiction, make no mistake about that, but her performance elsewhere is unimpressive at best. Memory of Chaos does not feature the types of enemy situations that allow Jade to thrive fully, and this is exacerbated by the fact that almost all of her preferred Debt Collector targets are similarly not used inside of Memory of Chaos, or if they are, they're being used in a completely different and highly specialised setup that does not have room for Jade (with the notable exception of Blade).The only real option she's got if she's being brought into Memory of Chaos is to be paired with Blade, and this is actually an incredibly potent setup, but it runs into the same problem that Blade teams have always had, which is that single-target damage ends up being comparatively very low. If the encounter has a lot of summoning of enemies or naturally starts with a high enemy count, it can be mitigated some, but if you're staring down the classic Boss-plus-one\u2122 then it's going to be quite a painful endeavour.Naturally, this downside means that Jade struggles too in Apocalyptic Shadow, as the AoE-focused nature of her kit means her Toughness damage is virtually non-existent against Big Bosses, and she simply doesn't provide anywhere near enough benefits to be able to handle the absurd HP bars present in that game mode that's run by Hunt, Super Break, and DoT. There is a very fringe case where Jade could be brought into a mono-Quantum type setup, or more specifically paired with Seele to masterfully play around the Resurgence buff, but this is incredibly high concept and is tremendously unlikely to be viable for the majority of the player base.Thus we come to the most important question: 'Why should I pull for Jade?'. It is very challenging to try and convince people to pull for a character whose only true claim to fame is in a game mode that is already dominated by plenty of other characters, many of whom are either completely free 4-stars or Standard 5-stars; Herta, Himeko, and Clara are all very accessible and very powerful all on their own. They already have dedicated setups that work extremely well and can make Pure Fiction a breeze, and that is without Jade, so unless someone is struggling immensely and doesn't have access to the aforementioned characters (You have Herta, she came free with your Stellaron), it's a bit tough to sell Jade.You may have wondered where the Eidolon section was, and I left it to last to illustrate the point a bit more. If it's difficult to recommend Jade in the mode she was designed to dominate, then what hope is there if she's also sandbagging in the other endgame modes? Well, for the low cost of a second copy of Jade, you can rectify these downsides. Jade's E1 increases the DMG% of her follow-up by 32%, and makes it so that she gains additional points of Charge if the Debt Collector character attacks fewer than 3 enemies, 1 extra if 2 enemies were hit, and 2 extra if 1 enemy was hit. Functionally this makes it so that Jade will always gain no fewer than 3 points of Charge per Debt Collector attack. Suddenly it's a lot more compelling to take her into low-target encounters.She doesn't need this Eidolon to do well in her designed space of Pure Fiction, she'll trivialise that for no additional cost. It's just a little unfortunate that if you really adamantly want to use her elsewhere in the endgame, it's going to cost you \u2014 either your Stellar Jades or your sanity, so choose wisely.Jade's E2 grants an additional 18% CRIT Rate when Pawned Asset reaches at least 15 stacks. E4 will give Jade a buff upon using her Ultimate where for the next 3 turns, Jade's DMG dealt will ignore 12% of enemy DEF, and E6 will allow Jade to gain a permanent 20% Quantum RES PEN while a Debt Collector is on field, and will also duplicate the Debt Collector status for herself as well.Obviously, if you are not a meta-chaser or are someone who is just a character collector, you should have no troubles justifying going for Jade. Similarly, if you are someone who does care about the endgame and struggle inside of Pure Fiction, Jade is also a pretty easy pickup. However, if you care about the endgame as a whole and are looking for overall account value from characters, then you may need to consider your options carefully before pulling for Jade, especially if you might end up going for her rather impactful E1.This is ultimately a choice for the individual player. Consider your options carefully before accepting the Faustian deal. Or maybe you're a Blade enjoyer, I don't know\u2014"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "The Dozing General of the Xianzhou Luofu is undeniably a very powerful and intimidating character. He\u2019s a character who performs well in spite of him being on the Path of Erudition; Jing Yuan is able to dole out great single-target damage in addition to already impressive AoE damage, and has bonus Crit stats for free that turn his already impressive damage up a notch.Interestingly enough, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell how strong he can be with just a glance at his overall multipliers\u2014they look rather modest, and that\u2019s putting it generously\u2026 right? You wouldn\u2019t know it, but the vast majority of Jing Yuan\u2019s damage in combat comes from his talent, potentially as much as 70%! Where on earth does that damage come from?Well, this is unfortunately a failure on the part of the skill description of Jing Yuan\u2019s talent mostly. See, Jing Yuan is always shadowed by an additional in-combat entity, his Lightning Lord. Lightning Lord has its own Speed value and will act independently of Jing Yuan, and if Jing Yuan is downed in combat, Lightning Lord will also peace out.The talent description is quite verbose and is rather confusing, resulting in many people severely underrating Jing Yuan as a character. Let\u2019s try and break it down.Lightning Lord\u2019s attacks target a random enemy, dealing 25% of its damage to adjacent targets. Its attacks are considered follow-ups, and Lightning Lord has the base values of 60 Speed, and an Attack Count of 3. One Attack Count equates to dealing up to 66% of Jing Yuan\u2019s atk at max trace level, which means Lightning Lord\u2019s base damage with its base 3 Attack Count is up to 198% of Jing Yuan\u2019s atk. Any further increases to this Attack Count will add on the value of 1 Attack Count to the current total.This means that you just take the base multiplier and multiply it by the current Attack Count to work out how much damage Lightning Lord\u2019s attack will deal. Since the absolute maximum amount of Attack Count is 10, this means Lightning Lord\u2019s attack can deal at most up to 660% of Jing Yuan\u2019s attack, and that\u2019s if it\u2019s only on one target. If there are multiple enemies all taking splash damage from each hit, it skyrockets to a theoretical maximum of 990%. Yeah, now you see where the ridiculous damage comes from.An important clarification is that each Attack Count introduces the increased damage as a whole new instance of damage. This means at 10 stacks, it deals that 660% multiplier as 10 separate hits of 66%, with each one targeting different enemies and splashing onto foes adjacent to them. This spreads the total damage out relatively evenly across all targets, with only some slight losses occurring if some of the damage targets corner targets (thus losing half of the splash damage), but overall is a quite consistent AoE damage tool. More obviously, in single-target scenarios, all of that damage gets concentrated on that one target, creating quite the damage nuke.In addition to this, every time Lightning Lord\u2019s Attack Count increases by 1, it will gain 10 extra Speed. This pushes its turn forward and allows Lightning Lord to get more attacks over the course of a fight. The reason this is important to facilitate is that as mentioned previously, the max Attack Count is 10, so if Jing Yuan is somehow able to act again before Lightning Lord attacks, you can end up losing out on damage due to overcapping the Attack Count. In practice, this is extremely unlikely unless you turbo-stack Speed onto Jing Yuan.Because each Attack Count adds the same amount of damage to Lightning Lord\u2019s next attack, the damage gains from each stack are entirely linear (with one caveat discussed later), but you ideally want to be getting stacks as high as possible for speed purposes. After Lightning Lord attacks, its Attack Count will return back to the base value of 3, and its speed will also return to the base value of 60.The way Jing Yuan increases the Attack Count of Lightning Lord is through his Skill and his Ultimate, and getting more uses out of each will increase the rate at which Lightning Lord can slam its heavenly spear directly through your enemies.Jing Yuan\u2019s skill deals AoE damage to all foes on the field, up to 100% atk to all at max trace level. A very unimpressive multiplier, but as we now know, this is not the main source of Jing Yuan\u2019s damage; using this skill will increase Lightning Lord\u2019s Attack Count by 2.Jing Yuan\u2019s ultimate is also an AoE attack, cleaving all enemies for up to 200% atk at max trace level, and simultaneously increasing Lightning Lord\u2019s Attack Count by 3. This is a great way of instantly increasing the Attack Count, but it comes at a steep above-average energy cost of 130.Because these two attacks increase Lightning Lord\u2019s Attack Count\u2014and more importantly, because basic attack does NOT increase Attack Count at all\u2014Jing Yuan always wants to be spending SP to use his skill, as this will increase Lightning Lord\u2019s Count, and will also regenerate more energy for Jing Yuan to get more ultimates off.His bonus traces are expertly tailored to improve his performance and serve to increase his scaling even further. Remember that one caveat that was alluded to earlier? Well, his A2 bonus trace is where this caveat is. I said earlier that each stack of Attack Count is a linear increase in damage, and that\u2019s true\u2026 up until you unlock his A2.A2 makes it so that if Lightning Lord\u2019s Attack Count is at 6 or above when it next attacks, its Crit Damage will be increased by 25%. This is an absurd bonus that will basically always be active unless Jing Yuan has his turn delayed. With even a small amount of investment into speed, 6 stacks is hardly a challenge to obtain otherwise, and you should always strive to reach at least 6 before Lightning Lord\u2019s next turn.This synergizes very well with Jing Yuan\u2019s A6, which increases his crit rate by 10% for 2 turns after using his skill, meaning Jing Yuan has easy access to free crit stats in his kit, something that is usually only seen on Hunt characters. A4 also gives Jing Yuan a bonus 15 energy at the start of a battle, giving him a head-start in reaching his ultimate and stacking Lightning Lord to the max.I do need to point out that maximizing Jing Yuan\u2019s effectiveness means you need to pay extra attention to your skill order and rotation; if you\u2019re the kind of person who is likely to be using Jing Yuan\u2019s skill when he\u2019s already at full energy, just as an example, you may notice that you inevitably run into scenarios where Lightning Lord is attacking before at least 6 stacks.You may also want to specifically try and concentrate all of Lightning Lord\u2019s immense power onto a single target, and so you\u2019d ideally want to focus-fire any surrounding lesser foes before Lightning Lord strikes to maximize the number of Attack Counts going onto the main foe. Either way, Jing Yuan benefits a lot from more attentive play, as even small overcaps on energy can add up a lot over the course of an entire encounter.However, despite the huge multiplier that Lightning Lord provides, it, unfortunately, does not always benefit fully from outside buff sources, meaning Jing Yuan loses out on a lot of the usefulness of potentially powerful buffs. In particular, because Jing Yuan desperately wants to be fast enough to gain as many stacks as possible for his Lightning Lord, Bronya would seem like a great pairing, but her damage buff from her Skill will always be gone by the time Lightning Lord attacks, and Lightning Lord itself is not a targetable entity.This means, rather unfortunately, that Jing Yuan cannot be pushed up the heights of other characters in a hypercarry setting, since buff alignment is difficult enough without needing to worry about Lightning Lord\u2019s turn order as well. Additionally, because Jing Yuan can seldom afford to avoid using his Skill, he is not a great flex pick either, meaning he is still ideally used as a hypercarry even with these prior limitations. Tingyun is far and away his best buffing support option, and even then it can be quite finicky to maximize their potential together. Stacking defense-shredding supports like Pela or Silver Wolf is likely the easier, and arguably better, strategy.Jing Yuan is a great character owing to his fantastic talent scaling and inherent crit buffs. He works well in almost all circumstances but requires extensive knowledge about buff timing and turn order to truly maximize. He is not a cheap unit and demands a lot, but he can definitely be worth your while.He also has spectacular hair. Even a general needs to look his best~"

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - CRIT DMG >= CRIT RateCRIT DMG is by far her best in slot Body main stat at high gear levels. Jingliu can hit the CRIT Rate cap far easier than other characters thanks to getting 50% for free, meaning stacking massive amounts of CRIT DMG% is insanely effective in the end-game. Hitting 50% CRIT Rate from set bonuses and sub-stats can be challenging without highly invested good relics meaning until that point a CRIT Rate body might be preferred.Feet - SpeedHitting the 134 Speed breakpoint for Jingliu is recommended for strong performance in Memory of Chaos and without Speed boots that is challenging. The alternative ATK% boots are also not appealing as Jingliu gets a lot of ATK% for free from her kit.Planar Sphere - Ice DMG > ATK%Ice DMG% is recommended for her Sphere in almost all scenarios as even with her Signature Cone equipped she does not gain that much access to generic increases to damage. While on the other hand, she gains access to an immense amount of % ATK.Link Rope - ATK%ATK% Rope is recommended as it is the only offensive scaling option available in this slot. Energy Recharge can be used as an experimental option but assuming Jingliu gets hit once or gets 1 kill in her 4-action rotation she requires no additional energy for standard gameplay.Additional notes for sub-statsJingliu gains 50% CRIT Rate for free while in the Transcendent state. Almost the entirety of Jingliu's damage occurs in the Transcendent state so you can assume your Jingliu has 50% CRIT Rate for free at all times.Like all damage dealers Jingliu wants enough Speed to hit the meaningful Memory of Chaos breakpoints to maximize her damage. Unlike other damage dealers, Speed is a little more important to Jingliu to smooth out her rotation and ensure she can access the Transcendent state as frequently as possible to line up more easily with team-wide buffs from Harmony or Nihility units. Hitting the 134 Speed breakpoint is a priority and not too difficult to achieve - with her Traces unlocked and level 15 gold Speed boots you'll have 130 Speed only requiring just 4 more which can be gained from 2-piece Hackerspace or 4-piece Musketeer or a couple of sub stats.Additional notes for Speed breakpoints105 Speed (Base) = No Bonus Actions (only recommended for incredibly low gear levels before you get any speed boots or for specific Bronya team compositions)121 Speed - gain a bonus action on the 2nd cycle of every new wave (only recommended for lower gear levels before getting level 15 gold Speed boots),134 Speed - gain a bonus action on the 1st and 4th cycle of every new wave (MOST RECOMMENDED).Team HP RequirementWith a max level talent in order to gain the full 180% increased ATK boost your other 3 team members need to have a combined total HP pool of 10500 for Jingliu to draw from, ensuring you meet this requirement is essential for maximizing your Jingliu's damage potential!Trace ImportanceUnlike some other 5-star characters, Jingliu gains a massive amount of damage from leveling her Traces - specifically her Skill and Talent - and maxing them out is incredibly important for achieving her full potential."

When there is no other source of Defense shred the Quantum set can provide less damage than other sets however these scenarios should be rare with proper team-building.Hunter of Glacial ForestGood set for Jingliu but is in a niche Cavern of Corrosion and not that much of an upgrade compared to other relic sets making it less of a priority to farm.Hunter of Glacial Forest + Pioneer Diver of Dead WatersThe 2-piece bonuses of both sets are enough to make it competitive - Jingliu gain enough ATK% from her kit, so the DMG% increase help her more.Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + Hunter of Glacial ForestGood combo if you have the pieces to support it but not enough of an improvement over other easier-to-acquire sets to farm for it specifically. The Speed helps hit the 134-speed breakpoint while also granting some increased damage.Musketeer of Wild WheatEasiest set to farm for. Likely you already have some decent pieces as you get some each week for free. 6% speed is welcome to more easily hit the 134 Speed breakpoint and while the Attack isn't her best stat it is an okay damage increase.Rutilant ArenaBy far Jingliu's best option. Provides her the most damage overall but also contributes 8% CRIT Rate to her goal of hitting 50% CRIT Rate to achieve 100% CRIT cap while in the Transcendent state which is quite difficult to hit while using a CRIT DMG body armor.Firmament Frontline: GlamothA good alternative to Rutilant even if you can only hit the first Speed breakpoint.Inert SalsottoHas 8% CRIT Rate similar to Rutilant Arena but boosts Ultimates and Follow-up attacks which is worse for Jingliu. Despite being a downgrade still her 2nd best option and does make gearing easier.Space Sealing StationHas no CRIT Rate making using the CRIT DMG chest incredibly difficult without insane gear. Also focuses on the ATK% stat which is not the greatest for Jingliu as she already gains 180% increased ATK from her Talent. Overall not a terrible option but makes gearing harder and only after you have insane gear to make up for it will it come close to Inert Salsotto's performance and will never beat Rutilant Arena."

Bronya Jingliu can be played in one of two ways. <br/> <br/> <b>Wheelchair Bronya</b>: This Bronya build stacks as much Speed as possible (161 minimum) and has Jingliu stack no Speed. Bronya will use her Skill on Jingliu every action to drag her along the action order and grant Bronya's Speed to Jingliu along with all of Bronya's buffs. This build lets Jingliu use her sub-stats, Boots main stat, and set bonus on something other than Speed all while getting all of Bronya's buffs. <br/> <br/> <b>Speed Sync Bronya</b>: Harder to setup but considered much stronger. The Speed sync Bronya build aims to sync up both Jingliu and Bronya's Speeds with only 1 Speed difference. Jingliu should be at 135/136 speed with Bronya at 134 speed. With this combo Jingliu will move first using her skill then right after Bronya will move and grant another turn straight to Jingliu allowing her to move again (with Bronya's buffs). This essentially grants Jingliu double the actions as normal assuming you have enough skill points to fuel it (thanks to Jingliu's kit you will have). This pairing allows Jingliu to permanently be in the Transcendent state - when she falls out of it her very next turn she'll use 1 normal skill to be immediately boosted by Bronya and use another normal skill to re-enter it."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Jingliu is a highly competitive damage dealer. She follows in the footsteps of Blade, and has many intrinsic ways to boost her damage output. She also naturally has Action Advance in her kit, granting her substantially more actions over time. These two things combined make her one of the most flexible units in the game, having a plethora of teammate options to choose from as well.The mysterious moonlit woman formerly renowned as the Sword Champion of the Luofu, Jingliu repeatedly proves that she is deserving of that title, and her feats in game are no exception.Jingliu\u2019s kit revolves primarily around her Talent. Jingliu can accumulate stacks of Syzygy, up to 3 in total. Whenever she has at least 2 stacks of Syzygy, she enters the Spectral Transmigration state. Entering this Spectral state will immediately advance her action by 100%, meaning it is now her turn. Note that this is different from an Extra Action; any kind of buffs or debuffs will continue to tick down on this advanced action as normal. Under the Spectral state, Jingliu gains up to 50% CRIT Rate at max Trace level, and her Skill is replaced by a special Enhanced version.Using attacks under Spectral Transmigration will siphon 4% Max HP from all other allies to increase Jingliu\u2019s ATK for the current attack. This part is written confusingly but it takes the total HP it steals from allies and multiplies it by 540% to get the total ATK increase it provides to Jingliu, up to a cap of 180% base ATK at max Trace level. With well-built characters in your team, this cap is pretty much attainable each and every time you attack in the Spectral state, resulting in far greater damage values than you\u2019d otherwise expect.Ordinarily, Jingliu\u2019s Skill is a single-target attack dealing up to 200% of her ATK. At the same time, it grants her 1 stack of Syzygy. This is her primary way of obtaining stacks of Syzygy for the purposes of her Talent. Under her Spectral state, this Skill becomes Enhanced, becoming a Blast AoE dealing 250% ATK to the primary target and 125% to adjacent foes. Most importantly, this Enhanced Skill does not cost a Skill Point, instead consuming 1 Stack of Syzygy. Her Spectral state will end upon reaching 0 stacks of Syzygy.Jingliu\u2019s Ultimate deals 300% ATK to a single enemy and 150% to adjacent foes. This will also grant 1 stack of Syzygy after the attack ends. While this can help her more quickly enter her Spectral state from base, it\u2019s far more effective to use it while already within the Spectral Transmigration state, as this will allow her Ultimate to benefit from the ATK increase from the HP syphon, as well as the increased CRIT Rate. This has the additional benefit of extending Spectral Transmigration for an extra turn, meaning you can get a third Enhanced Skill in before you run out of Syzygy.Usually, I don\u2019t mention characters\u2019 Techniques unless they\u2019re of particular note, and Jingliu\u2019s most definitely is. She creates a dimension around herself for 20s, freezing all enemies around you. Entering combat while the dimension is active will immediately regenerate 15 Energy for Jingliu and grant a stack of Syzygy. This head start is nothing particularly new since a lot of characters have something like this, but it also has a 100% base chance of Freezing all enemies for 1 turn. Because this is a dimension effect, this Freeze will also be reapplied at the start of every new enemy wave, which is exceptionally powerful, especially in Memory of Chaos.Jingliu\u2019s Bonus Traces are pretty impactful for her. A2 provides Jingliu a 35% increase to Effect RES during Spectral Transmigration, helping combat Crowd Control effects somewhat. A6 provides her Ultimate with 20% extra damage if used during Spectral Transmigration, further incentivizing using it during that state. A4 is potentially quite significant as well, offering a 10% Action Advance upon using her ordinary Skill, reducing the downtime between the end of the previous Spectral Transmigration and the beginning of her next one.Jingliu also has the first instance of SPD Minor Traces, giving her an additional 9 SPD. Note that like all Minor Traces, this is not added to the base value and is instead additional. She\u2019s also got an absurd 37% CRIT DMG from Traces, the highest of any character thus far. Coupled with her 50% CRIT Rate from Spectral Transmigration, she has a lot of free stats to work with.This can create an interesting dilemma however. These stats encourage going for a CRIT DMG chest piece which is likely to be her best choice, but because of the free CRIT Rate she gets, it\u2019s actually quite possible to reach 100% and reach the fabled realm of guaranteed crits. Attaining this with a CRIT DMG chest piece, so as to retain a high CRIT DMG stat along with the 100% CRIT Rate, can be quite challenging. However, while this can become a pretty big investment sink, the payoff if you actually achieve this is astonishing and well worth the effort. If that doesn\u2019t sound like something you want to subject yourself to though, rest easy knowing that Jingliu really doesn\u2019t require this to be spectacular.Eidolons are not necessary at all, but E1 is potentially quite enticing; it gives Jingliu 24% extra CRIT DMG for 1 turn when using her Ultimate or Enhanced Skill, and if only a single target is attacked, the target will receive additional damage which drastically increases Jingliu's single target damage potential.Just like Blade, Jingliu is very flexible in her team setups; because of Jingliu\u2019s low and infrequent SP usage, she can take advantage of some quite SP-hungry supports like Yukong or Bronya. Bronya especially is a very potent pairing due to Jingliu\u2019s kit revolving around total action count, and with both of them having a way to fully Turn Advance Jingliu to the front, Jingliu ends up having a ridiculous amount of turns over the course of a fight, leading to more damage and significantly more Toughness damage.Additionally, because of the low SP expenditure, Jingliu is also highly capable of acting as a secondary damage dealer for a team. Similarly, she is also able to have a secondary damage dealer act alongside her, potentially even one that also occasionally enjoys using SP, provided you still generate enough through your other two party members. This makes Jingliu\u2019s application near limitless, just like Blade.Clearly, Jingliu and Blade have many similarities, as I\u2019ve mentioned relentlessly by this point. Jingliu deals slightly more damage, but Blade is unkillable, and both of them perform exceptionally. But you know what\u2019s better than using just one of the two? Wink wink, nudge nudge?Yeah\u2026 Turns out that even though they hate each other in the lore, Jingliu and Blade have a particularly strong synergy with each other. Both are completely self-sufficient in their damage, and already highly competitive, but Jingliu can enhance Blade\u2019s capabilities substantially. Blade\u2019s Talent gains a stack whenever he takes damage, and Jingliu has a way of facilitating this through attacks during Spectral Transmigration. 3 Enhanced Skills and an Ultimate from Jingliu during Spectral will provide 4 separate instances of HP syphon, meaning she provides 4 stacks for Blade\u2019s Talent every time she enters Spectral Transmigration. Combining this with Blade\u2019s natural HP consumption and any potential incoming enemy damage makes for extremely frequent follow-ups from Blade.Just these two together already make the team remarkably potent, and as soon as you start adding in other support options, it just gets more and more powerful and ridiculous. This may even potentially be Jingliu\u2019s best team, and it ends up being pretty universally applicable too. Of course, it\u2019s a tad expensive and relies on you having two limited rate-up characters, but even if you don\u2019t have this exact setup, Jingliu is a more than capable damage dealer all on her own.Imbibitor Lunae will likely always have the higher upfront damage numbers per turn because his multipliers are just too high, but over the course of a fight, Jingliu can do a substantial\u2014and more importantly, comparable\u2014amount of total damage as well. You just have to take your pick: death by a thousand cuts, or death by sledgehammer. Same same but different. She\u2019s well worth your time, even if it\u2019s just for the remarkable flexibility in her design.\u00a0Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to look up how to pronounce \u2018Syzygy\u2019. "

            "formatted": "The Spirit Whisperer and Destiny\u2019s Slave, Kafka expertly carries out large-scale devastation. She is capable of instantaneously triggering DoT damage on enemies, meaning that with some setup in applying several damage over time debuffs to enemies, Kafka can swoop in and snap enemies out of existence. Due to her DoT-heavy gameplay, Kafka also enjoys focusing almost exclusively on ATK% and some Effect Hit Rate, meaning she does not care for CRIT stats at all.Kafka\u2019s Skill is what acts as this metaphorical snap. She deals damage to a target enemy as a Blast AoE, hitting adjacent foes as well, and if the enemy you targeted has DoT debuffs on them, they will all immediately deal up to 75% of their original damage. Yes, all of them. Get yourself some DoT-applying teammates and watch the fireworks happen.Her Ultimate can help start the chain. She deals up to 80% of her ATK to all enemies and has a 100% base chance to apply Shock for 2 turns. In addition to this, enemies will also instantly take a damage instance from said Shock state upon application, a whopping 290% of Kafka\u2019s ATK at max Trace Level.Kafka\u2019s Talent is also quite a cheeky tool to apply Shock early. When any ally uses a Basic ATK on an enemy, Kafka will instantly perform a follow-up attack onto that target, dealing up to 140% of her ATK and having a 100% base chance to apply the same Shock debuff as the one on her Ultimate. She only gets to do this once per turn, but considering you\u2019re going to have some of your other teammates Basic Attacking a lot, this is pretty much guaranteed to be used at every available instance.Her Bonus Traces just add to this by improving her consistency with A6 by increasing the base chance for her own Shock debuffs to be applied by 30%, for a new base chance of 130%, and allowing her Ultimate to also explode all DoTs instead of just Shock with her A2. Her A4 grants 5 energy back when a Shocked enemy is defeated.Kafka really has no need for her Eidolons to be superb, but her E1 and E2 allow her to amplify overall DoT damage for herself and her allies, with E1 causing a target hit by her Talent to take 30% more DoT damage, and E2 increasing all allies\u2019 DoT damage by 25% while Kafka is alive and on the field. Again, Kafka does not need either of these but they are potentially valuable things to have and are comparatively quite accessible should you wish to pull for Eidolons.Kafka is really not that complicated; the game plan is simple, right? Just apply as many DoT debuffs on enemies as you can and then have Kafka obliterate them. Well\u2026 Sort of. Due to the nature of Kafka\u2019s kit, she can safely ignore the typically important stats like CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG, since DoTs simply aren\u2019t capable of hitting crits. However, again due to the nature of Kafka\u2019s kit, she wants SPD and she wants an obscene amount of it. Getting enough Effect Hit Rate and SPD without sacrificing ATK% can be genuinely quite hard.Adding to this, Kafka\u2019s preferred teammate lineup can also be very against the grain. For Harmony characters, Yukong is completely wasted on Kafka as the CRIT buffs do not help her. For Bronya, aside from the Turn Advance, Bronya\u2019s CRIT buffs are also entirely wasted on a DoT-centric team. Bronya is however still usable, and maybe even good in highly optimized settings, but is generally better used on your second side team.Instead, a great Harmony teammate is everyone\u2019s favorite Lead Researcher, Asta. She can increase everyone\u2019s ATK and SPD, two things that Kafka absolutely cannot have too much of. Tingyun is also great as her Ultimate can provide more Ultimate uptime for Kafka, and Tingyun\u2019s ATK% buff can be maintained on Kafka permanently, but Tingyun is exclusively buffing Kafka, so using other DoT characters in this situation can be unfavorable.Kafka can choose to instead be paired with more DoT-inflicting characters. In these situations, the most important thing for Kafka is to have enough DoTs on the enemy to actually dish out small nuclear detonations, meaning she wants to be paired with characters who apply said DoT. In particular, Sampo Koski\u2019s DoT enhancing Ultimate finally has a real use case, and seeing as he can apply up to 5 stacks of Wind Shear at a breakneck pace and also maintain them, he is a complete no-brainer pairing with Kafka. For tough single-target encounters, Luka also makes a fantastic teammate due to his absurdly high Max HP% damage from Bleed.Final good pairs are of course other Nihility units and debuffers. Pela and Silver Wolf can contribute immensely to increasing the team\u2019s overall damage, far more than a Harmony character (besides maybe Asta and Bronya) would be able to. Silver Wolf in particular being able to implant weaknesses into enemies allows Kafka to frequently get additional sources of DoT from Weakness Breaks, amplifying damage even further.The issue comes with maintaining these teams, as they tend to be really quite SP-intensive. Sampo can mostly switch to Basic Attacking after his Wind Shear is stacked, but if you\u2019re using Luka or Silver Wolf, you may struggle to keep up with the SP costs, and the absolute worst-case scenario is Kafka being unable to use her Skill because she is pretty much all of that team\u2019s damage. The teammates also need to be very well built since the DoT explosion from her Skill and Ultimate are based on your teammates\u2019 DoT stats, so don\u2019t expect Kafka to hit crazy hard in the late game if your Sampo is level 20.There\u2019s been a lot of mention of Sampo in this review, and that\u2019s no accident. Kafka does not currently have a true dedicated support for her style of gameplay. It just so happens that Sampo is the closest to being that for her, and as such is the next best thing. While Kafka can make do with someone like Serval, Kafka really wants to be paired with Sampo because he synergizes the best with what she wants to do, and not by a small margin. This may change in the future, and maybe a perfect support unit is released for Kafka, but please do not pull for Kafka with the hopes that that will occur, because there\u2019s absolutely no guarantee.\u00a0She is a great character already, and she can perform fantastically, especially with Sampo, or with Tingyun and Asta, having a theoretical damage ceiling far above the clouds of most other characters, and future DoT-based characters are likely to work well with her as well, but if you want to pull for her, do it for her and not for hypothetical future releases, even if they would, in theory, be amazing together.Besides, who doesn\u2019t love looking at fireworks? \u201cBoom.\u201d"

            "formatted": "Luka is a single target, DoT-based Nihility character. Luka efficiently dispatches his foes by inflicting Bleed with his Skill, dealing damage equal to 24% of the enemy\u2019s Max HP but no more than 338% of Luka\u2019s ATK, and increasing the DMG they receive with his Ultimate by up to 20%.The reigning Fight Club champ with a heart of gold and a fist full of steel, Luka\u2019s got plenty of tricks up his singular sleeve to deal extremely consistent damage and even amplify his team\u2019s damage.His Skill is the focal point. He attacks a single target and deals up to 120% of his ATK, and additionally inflicts a powerful Bleed DoT onto his target, making them take 24% of their Max HP as Physical damage at the start of each turn for 3 turns. This would be too absurd on its own, so there is an upper limit attached to this, where the Bleed DoT cannot exceed more than 338% of Luka\u2019s ATK at max Trace level.Ordinarily, Bleed is a powerful DoT to use against high Max HP foes, as its Weakness Break counterpart also deals a percentage of the enemy\u2019s Max HP at the start of every turn, but the upper limit for that depends on your Break Effect%. This means that against particularly high-health enemies (especially level 90 and in Memory of Chaos), Break Bleed can do astounding damage. With the upper limit on Luka\u2019s Skill, it\u2019s harder to reach those kinds of damage amounts without copious amounts of ATK boosts, and even then beyond a certain point, Break Bleed will exceed those values.However, Luka is in fact a Physical character. You can absolutely have both DoTs active if Luka is the one to Weakness Break the enemy, and this means that Luka can contribute a colossal amount of Max HP damage by himself. This is compounded further by his Ultimate.Luka\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 330% of Luka\u2019s ATK to a single target and has a 100% base chance to increase the DMG they take by up to 20% for a whopping 3 turns. Important to note, this is the same kind of rare damage amplification that Welt possesses on his Ultimate, and it goes a long way to increasing the damage of Luka\u2019s Bleeds, as well as the overall damage of the entire team. Especially in DoT-based setups or instances of high single-hit damage, this damage amp is invaluable.Luka\u2019s Talent is the beans to the toast of his Skill. Using his Basic ATK or Skill will grant him 1 stack of Fighting Will, up to 4 total. Using his Ultimate will instantly grant 2 stacks. When he has at least 2 stacks, Luka\u2019s Basic ATK will be Enhanced, consuming 2 stacks to deal 3 hits of up to 20% ATK followed by a final blow dealing up to 80% at max Basic ATK Trace level. It doesn\u2019t sound too impressive on its own, but that\u2019s because the Talent has another effect.After hitting a Bleeding foe with Luka\u2019s Enhanced Basic ATK, the Bleed status will immediately deal DMG equal to up to 85% of its original DMG to the target, meaning Luka can force proc the Bleed effects that an enemy has. This pushes the already strong Max HP% damage forward, compounding his damage contribution even further still.Luka\u2019s Bonus Traces are good. A2 gives his Skill a dispel effect, making him extremely useful against foes that have pesky self-buffs like the Mara Struck or the Searing Prowler. A4 grants 3 energy every time he obtains a stack of Fighting Will, and A6 has a 50% fixed chance to make the small hits of his Enhanced Basic ATK hit an extra time, though this doesn\u2019t apply to any of the hits that count as extras, meaning he can hit up to 6 times before the uppercut instead of just 3.In terms of Eidolons, E1, and E6 are the most impactful, with E1 granting a 2 turn 15% DMG bonus if Luka attacks a Bleeding enemy, and E6 adding additional forced Bleed procs on every small hit of his Enhanced Basic ATK, 8% per hit for a maximum total of 48% of the original Bleed being dealt before the uppercut deals the Talent amount of 85%. They\u2019re not necessary for Luka to see success, but are instead \u2018win more\u2019 upgrades.Because of his DoT-centric gameplay, Luka doesn\u2019t care for CRIT stats at all. He wants to stack as much ATK and SPD as possible so that he can continue to smack the enemy around and force Bleed damage as often as possible. This has the unfortunate side effect of meaning that many of the best support options lose a great deal of value when paired with Luka exclusively; Bronya and Yukong in particular have their CRIT buffs almost entirely wasted and would be better spent on a more directly damaging character.As such, Luka is better used as a supplementary damage dealer, one that only infrequently needs to use his Skill to apply Bleed and can spend the remainder of his time using Basic ATKs, Enhanced or otherwise. Especially due to his damage amplification and dispel capabilities, Luka makes for an excellent hybrid of single target support and damage dealer, with a big benefit of his being a very consistent damage output, and a damage amplification effect that interfaces with an entirely different portion of the DMG formula when compared to DEF Reduction.Again, while he is very good at what he does, he is not really capable of matching the raw output of other dedicated damage dealers. Luka gets stronger as the enemy gains more health, but due to the upper limit on his Skill\u2019s Bleed, there will still come a point where he can\u2019t go any further on his own. Being exclusively single target is also something that is becoming increasingly problematic when it comes to end-game content like Memory of Chaos, and so Luka is likely best suited for pursuing high HP Elites or Bosses while supporting the team with his Ultimate\u2019s debuff.Now all I need to do is think of a clever nickname for him to end this review on. \u201cSingle Strike Dude\u201d? No\u2026 maybe \u201cLone Hit Person\u201d? There has to be something catchier than that, surely\u2026\u00a0"

            "formatted": "Luocha is a strong Abundance sustain with a high degree of comfort to his kit. His Talent maintains an AoE healing field called Abyss Flower that will heal allies who attack enemies, as well as healing a smaller amount to everyone else. His Ultimate will attack all enemies and dispelling one buff from them, and his Skill has a passive component that will automatically heal an ally who falls below 50% HP outside of Luocha's turn. Because of the ease of keeping his field active and his emergency heal on his Skill, Luocha is arguably the most SP positive sustain option in the game.The mysterious Raksha continues to be a solid performer in all metrics. His ease of use has kept him quite popular even in the midst of new sustain units with more of an offensive angle to them like Fu Xuan or Huohuo, and Luocha's excellent SP economy means he's still a prime pick for particularly SP hungry teams. His offensive Ultimate and lack of need for SP means he can also contribute a good bit of Toughness damage too.Luocha's Talent is the big draw. When he uses his Skill or his Ultimate, he will gain 1 stack of Abyss Flower, and at 2 stacks he will deploy his Abyss Flower field. While the field is active, allies who attack enemies will have their health restored by up to 18% of Luocha's *ATK* plus 240. Indeed, Luocha's healing scales with the ATK stat instead of with HP like many other Abundance units. This doesn't really translate to dealing more damage, mind you, it's just a different way to scale his healing.Abyss Flower lets the team stay on the offensive without needing to worry about chip damage from enemies or pesky DoT effects. It also means Luocha's healing throughput is virtually unparalleled as he's constantly healing the team on everyone's turn, assuming they're attacking something. Even better is that it's not like traditional life-steal you may be familiar with, it's a fixed healing value based on his Talent's Trace level, meaning even your zero-damage support characters can fully benefit from the effects of Abyss Flower.It's useful to note that this will consider all attacks for the healing, meaning any offensive Ultimates will also trigger the healing effect, potentially allowing for some very last-minute emergency healing that saves a teammate's life. This even extends to Luocha's own Ultimate, though this is a truly last resort action, as Luocha cannot gain any more Abyss Flower stacks while his field is already active.Luocha's Skill will heal a single ally for up to 60% ATK plus 800 and grant him 1 stack of Abyss Flower. Whenever an ally's HP percentage drops to 50% or below, he will automatically use this Skill at no cost, immediately as an Extra Action, and heal said ally. This emergency heal effect has a 2 turn cooldown. This emergency heal is functionally the same as if he'd used the Skill normally, meaning it also gives a stack of Abyss Flower, and more importantly, grants the same amount of Energy of 30.This emergency heal passive is what results in Luocha's vastly increased SP economy; with his Ultimate and Skill granting a stack of Abyss Flower each, he can maintain the field almost indefinitely, and anyone who loses too much HP at once will immediately be healed by the Skill's passive. This gives Luocha full freedom to only ever use his Basic ATK, contributing Toughness DMG and applying Abyss Flower's healing himself. With a Light Cone like Multiplication, this makes Luocha one of the fastest acting and fastest SP restoring characters in the game, and is a big reason why he still finds so much use.Luocha's Ultimate will hit all enemies on the field, dealing up to 200% ATK and removing 1 buff from every enemy hit. This will also grant 1 stack of Abyss Flower. While we are no longer lacking for Imaginary units as we once were, Imprisonment is still as powerful as ever, and having the healer be able to Break enemies and send them to the shadow realm is quite nice. It also completely dunks on pesky foes like the Shape-Shifter with their own life-steal field, and will also easily dispel annoying DMG Barriers like the ones Automaton Beetles get.This offensive Ultimate comes at the cost of not having an emergency healing Ultimate like what many of the other Abundance units have, such as Natasha or Lynx. While it is extremely unlikely to get into a rough spot like that with Luocha's Abyss Flower around, it is nevertheless a non-zero possibility, and recovering from a situation where everyone is dangerously low on HP can be tricky with Luocha if he is not sufficiently invested for Abyss Flower to pick up the slack. Even then, this is only useful if you have teammates who can actually attack the enemies, so buffing supports who only ever target allies will not be able to benefit from this as much as you may want.Luocha's A2 Bonus Trace gives his Skill heal a cleanse effect, removing 1 debuff from the targeted ally. This naturally also applies to his Skill's emergency passive, meaning you can very easily circumvent otherwise deadly scenarios, such as when an ally is hit for the majority of their HP bar and also, say, Entangled or Imprisoned. Luocha will have that covered no problem.A4 will add additional healing to Abyss Flower, healing everyone else besides the attacker 7% ATK plus 93. It's a much lower value but now Abyss Flower is capable of healing everyone all at once, increasing Luocha's already ridiculous healing throughput. This can also actively help to prevent those aforementioned dangerous situations in which not having a healing Ultimate may be detrimental, though the same weaknesses apply \u2014 you need someone to actually hit enemies to get the healing.Luocha's A6 is pretty nuts as it gives him a passive 70% chance to resist all crowd-control effects. This is not like Effect RES and is its own thing, meaning it is extremely unlikely that Luocha will be made unable to act. Essentially this is to prevent Luocha from being unable to use his Skill's passive, actually making it a consistent source of emergency healing even against heavy crowd-control. However, basic maths says that this is in fact not 100% resistance, so it is still possible for Luocha to get crowd-controlled \u2014 *it's extremely unlikely* but it is ultimately a non-zero chance.Luocha does not need Eidolons to succeed, but they are a nice boost to have. E1 in particular will allow his Abyss Flower field to additionally provide a passive 20% ATK boost to the entire party, and if you're mad enough to chase E6, his Ultimate will reduce all enemies All-Type RES by 20%, giving him fantastic universal benefits. Again, definitely not necessary, but it's here if you want it.Luocha's place in the meta has remained somewhat consistent. He's undeniably good at what he does, and he's been solving SP issues for teams since his inception. However, newer sustain units ever since Fu Xuan have been doing something other than just raw sustaining; it's no longer enough to just be a pure healer or shielder, you have to offer something else to the team... Unless you're Luocha.See, the issue is not that Luocha doesn't do enough to justify his position, it's that everyone else has to do more than just heal to justify their spot \u2014 Luocha is the pinnacle of healing because that's what he was designed to do, and any new units who do it better would just be considered a direct powercreep of Luocha. The man is literally so good at his primary role that he's forced all future sustain units to do more than just sustain, because if that's all they do, they'll inevitably get a one-to-one comparison to Luocha, and that is guaranteed to be a losing battle.Fu Xuan sidestepped the issue by tackling the one issue Luocha has which is dealing with one-shot abilities from enemies, but her own healing is still far less than Luocha's to where you're not really being sustained, you're just dying really really slowly \u2014 slow enough to where it's imperceptible if you can defeat enemies fast enough.Huohuo introduced a truly new way for sustain units to function, but in order to balance her highly coveted ATK buff and Energy restore, her actual healing needs far more effort than Luocha since it requires proper SP management to take full advantage of. This is probably the biggest reason why Luocha still sees so much use: he's just easy, folks. It really is that simple. Even if Huohuo can claim to be the 'objectively superior option' as far as offensive utility is concerned, for some it's just not worth the extra hassle.Having said that, if survivability is not your bottleneck, then Luocha will actually be a worse option than someone like Huohuo. It sets an interesting and possibly dangerous precedent for future sustain characters, because as mentioned, Luocha remains strong because his actual sustain is comfy and almost unmatched. If a new sustain character comes out who provides more than just sustain while also matching Luocha's ease of use or healing throughput, then Luocha may very well be out of a job for many players.He'll always have his excellent SP economy going for him, but more and more this is becoming less relevant, and there is always the argument to be made that if you're having SP issues, it's an overall teambuilding issue. Even still, it seems extraordinarily unlikely that a unit will come out that will completely overshadow all aspects of Luocha's kit, and even when there is already a character like Huohuo out there whom many players consider outright better than Luocha, the usage statistics just don't lie, and the enigmatic Raksha earns his keep.If you are lacking a good limited 5-star sustain unit, you shouldn't even need to think twice about going for Luocha. He's comfortable, consistent, and verifiably good. He's a daily driver for many, and for good reason.The prevailing question remains... Do you trust him?"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Lynx is an extremely competent healer. She combines the best aspects of Natasha and Bailu into one, providing healing over time from both her Skill and Ultimate, as well as being able to increase an ally\u2019s Max HP by a significant amount with her Skill. She can even increase an ally\u2019s aggro with her Skill if the ally is Destruction or Preservation, making her even better at mitigating damage for the team. Couple all of that with an AoE cleanse on her Ultimate and HP scaling Basic ATKs, and you\u2019ve got an exceptional healer, especially for a 4*.Many readily available defensive support options are insufficient on their own in difficult content like Memory of Chaos or Swarm Disaster, and all of the truly good options are 5*s, meaning they\u2019re largely inaccessible unless you get really really lucky. Enter Lynx, resident canned fish enjoyer, another member of the Landau family, and, most importantly, a 4* healer.An interesting thing to note right off the bat is that Lynx\u2019 Basic ATK scales with her Max HP instead of her ATK. She deals up to 50% of her Max HP at max Trace level, and since the rest of her kit also scales with HP, it\u2019s extremely likely that Lynx is going to be contributing surprisingly good amounts of damage as your dedicated healer, and this automatically puts her above the likes of Natasha and Bailu in terms of damage contribution\u2014even though Natasha\u2019s E6 adds a HP scaling to her Basic ATK, it\u2019s still only 40% of Nat\u2019s Max HP. Lynx gets to do it for free.Lynx\u2019 Skill targets a single ally and heals them for up to 12% of Lynx\u2019 Max HP plus 320 at max Trace level. This already makes it directly superior to Natasha\u2019s Skill, but it elevates it even further by also increasing the targeted ally\u2019s Max HP by up to 7.5% of Lynx\u2019 Max HP plus 200, meaning a well-invested Lynx can add a significant amount of HP to an ally. The added bonus is that if the targeted ally is on the Path of Destruction or Preservation, they are granted Survival Response, and have a vastly increased chance to be attacked, meaning that you can create a similar sort of effect as if you had Gepard in your team; pick a durable ally and turn them into the primary target for enemies to attack. These effects only last for 2 turns, however, so you need to be mindful of the SP you have available if you wish to maintain this playstyle.Her Ultimate heals all allies for up to 13.5% of Lynx\u2019 Max HP plus 360, putting it just barely below Natasha\u2019s Ultimate, but it has the added benefit of also being an AoE cleanse, something we\u2019ve not yet seen a character be capable of. This allows Lynx to essentially salvage the previously unsalvageable; if you had the other three members of your team Frozen or Imprisoned, you\u2019d likely be in a losing situation, but with Lynx you can nullify that harsh Crowd Control and get back into the fight. The only thing to note is that this cleanse applies to all debuffs, meaning that you can run into the same issue as always with multiple debuffs, where you can end up cleansing the wrong debuff and still dying. While having this AoE cleanse tied to an Ultimate is handy in a pinch, Natasha and Luocha can at least use a Skill back-to-back to cleanse things if necessary, and Lynx does not have this luxury.Lynx\u2019 Talent makes an appearance whenever she heals an ally. Her Skill and Ultimate will apply a regen effect for 2 turns, restoring up to 3.6% of Lynx\u2019 Max HP plus 96 at the start of the ally\u2019s turn. It increases by an additional 4.5% plus 120 if the targeted ally is affected by Survival Response, making this a very noticeable heal over time for the units you designate as your tank. Since this is applied on all healing, including her Ultimate, it makes Lynx a very SP efficient healer.With her Bonus Traces, Lynx\u2019 performance notably improves. Her A2 provides Lynx with a bonus 2 Energy each time a unit with Survival Response is hit, lessening the burden of Energy requirements and potentially allowing for more Ultimates, though it does require SP to be used to apply Survival Response in the first place. Her A4 provides a 35% chance to resist Crowd Control, making it less likely that she\u2019ll be taken out of the fight and allowing her to be ready to cleanse allies if necessary. Finally, her A6 extends the duration of her Talent\u2019s regen effect by 1 turn, for a new total of 3 turns. This just makes Lynx better at what she was already doing, and also helps bridge the gap between Ultimate usages, potentially allowing for permanent uptime on the healing over time.As a 4* character, it is entirely possible to get Eidolons for Lynx over time, but they\u2019re actually not a necessity for Lynx to be an excellent healer. Particularly noteworthy is her E2, which allows an ally with Survival Response to resist debuff application one time, and her E6, which further increases the Max HP boost by 6% of Lynx\u2019 Max HP and also increases the ally\u2019s Effect RES by 30%.Lynx is a simple but effective character, and one that players are going to want to get their hands on as soon as possible. While it is expected that Lynx is going to be compared to the other healers we have, currently it\u2019s surprisingly one-sided; really only Luocha is better than Lynx and that\u2019s because he monopolizes the hands-off healing approach and does it too well to ever be overtaken. The really impressive thing is that Lynx is next in the line, which is even more impressive seeing as she is a 4*. While Lynx lacks the Outgoing Healing boosts of Natasha and the reactive healing from Bailu\u2019s Invigoration, she is much stronger than Natasha already at E0 and she has the potential to be better than Bailu (at higher Eidolons). If Lynx ever becomes a freely accessible unit, F2P players will finally have enough healers to tackle Memory of Chaos without fear.Lynx is pretty phenomenal actually. She also appreciates the value of a Thermos, so you should definitely be able to appreciate her. Preparedness is a sign of great wisdom, you know."

            "formatted": "March 7th, The Hunt edition, is an incredibly powerful unit that's obtained entirely for free including Eidolons. She can choose to boost a single ally's SPD and will also get personal benefits to her Enhanced Basic ATK based on the Path of the buffed character, getting either Additional DMG instances or increasing her Weakness Break Efficiency. She deals very high single-target damage and can reduce the Toughness of non-IMG weak enemies, and she can be played as a strong CRIT carry or as a strong Breaker. Because of this, she is extremely flexible.Everyone's favorite goofball got her own personal anime training arc, and has upgraded from March 7th to March 8th. This new Reignbow Arbiter flavoured form boasts one of the most versatile damage carry kits in the game, and most ridiculous of all is that we're given her for free, and will even get all of her Eidolons over time.The big focus of March's kit comes from her Enhanced Basic ATK. It initially deals 3 hits, with each dealing up to 80% ATK to a single enemy. After the final hit, there's a 60% fixed chance to deal an extra hit, up to 3 extra hits. This Enhanced Basic cannot recover Skill Points, and will not recover extra Energy with more hits, but as compensation, it will restore a typical Skill's worth of Energy, 30 Energy per usage.March's big damage comes from her Enhanced Basic ATK, but we've got to get through her other abilities first to understand how everything interacts with one another and where the real juice comes from. This starts at her Skill. March designates a single ally besides herself as Shifu, increasing their SPD by up to 10%. This Shifu designation lasts until March recasts her Skill. March will gain benefits for her Basic ATK and Enhanced Basic ATK based on the Path of her chosen Shifu; if the Shifu follows the Path of Erudition, Destruction, or The Hunt, then her Basic ATK and every singular hit of her Enhanced Basic will deal up to 20% ATK Additional DMG. If the Shifu follows the Path of Abundance, Nihility, Harmony, or Preservation, her Basic ATK and every singular hit of her Enhanced Basic will deal +100% Toughness damage (different from Weakness Break Efficiency).This unique interaction allows March to be played as a traditional CRIT carry or as a dedicated Super Breaker. On its own, this may not seem impressive enough compared to existing characters who can fill these two roles already, but this is only the surface. March's Ultimate will deal up to 240% ATK to a single enemy and will increase the initial number of hits of her Enhanced Basic by 2 hits, for a new base amount of 5 hits. In addition to this, it will also increase the fixed chance of getting extra hits by 20%, for a new total of 80% fixed chance. This Ultimate has a below-average cost of 110.Aside from the upfront damage of this Ultimate and its Toughness damage, this will turbo-charge March's next Enhanced Basic to be insanely powerful, potentially dealing up to an insane 800% ATK to a single enemy. Even if you are laughably unlucky and somehow don't get any additional hits, this Enhanced Basic will still do 500% ATK after the Ultimate, which for an attack that costs literally zero Skill Points, that's pretty damn strong.March's Talent tells us how she gains access to her Enhanced Basic. After the designated Shifu uses an attack or an Ultimate, March 8th gets 1 point of Charge. When she gets at least 7 points of Charge, March will immediately be Action Advanced by 100% and will gain up to an 80% DMG boost for this turn. Her Basic ATK gets Enhanced and she cannot use her Skill. After using her Enhanced Basic ATK, she consumes 7 points of Charge, and can hold up to 10 points at once. March's regular Basic ATK will also generate 1 point of Charge, though her Enhanced Basic will not generate any.This Talent is nuts; a free way to gain massive amounts of free DMG% as well as getting a full Action Advance for doing nothing more than you were already doing is ludicrous, and depending how you sort her teams, March is getting this quite a bit. You may have noticed that because her primary source of damage is from an Enhanced Basic, and she has no need to use more than a single Skill Point at the start of the fight, March is dealing all this crazy damage and breaking while being COMPLETELY SP POSITIVE. This is absolutely unheard of, and we're not even at the end yet.See, this is already criminally strong for a free 4-star unit, but we've got her Bonus Ability Traces and Eidolons left. Her A2 will Action Advance March 8th by 25% at the start of combat. Like similar Bonus Abilities from other characters like Robin or Guinaifen, this allows March to be among the first characters to act in a fight, making it easier to designate an ally as Shifu before any actual fighting has started. March's A6 will provide the Shifu with 60% CRIT DMG and 36% Break Effect for 2 turns after March uses her Enhanced Basic ATK, which is a remarkably powerful boost with very high uptime that, once again, is attained by doing what you were already doing.I had to separate out her A4 because it's quite possibly the dumbest thing I've ever read in my life. March 8th can reduce the Toughness of enemies whose Weakness Type is the same as the Shifu's Combat Type. Yes, that does mean what you think it means. Whoever March makes the Shifu, that character's Element can now also be damaged by March; if you designate a Fire character the Shifu, March will now also deal Toughness damage to enemies with a Fire Weakness, even if they are not also weak to Imaginary, and she does that at 100% efficiency. For free. If she Breaks the enemy, she triggers Imaginary Break.We've got a space cowboy who can implant his Weakness Type onto enemies and stops caring about Weaknesses once an enemy is Broken, and we've had an orbital frame who freely implants her Weakness onto enemies. March says 'Don't care. Perish.' Simply deal the Toughness damage, it's just that easy. Now you can carefully pair March with a character who has a good Elemental matchup and laugh maniacally as the enemies get shredded. 'But I don't even have an Imaginary Weakness!', say your enemies. 'Don't care. Perish', says March.As I said before, we will eventually gain access to all of March's Hunt Eidolons, and they're just as crazy as the rest of her kit. E1 will increase March's SPD by 10% when the Shifu is on the field, essentially granting herself the same SPD bonus as she can grant another character. E2 is the final piece of the puzzle for March's game plan. After the Shifu uses a Basic ATK or Skill to attack an enemy, March 7th will immediately do a follow-up attack equal to 60% ATK to the attacked enemy. This follow-up will also grant 1 point of Charge to March. If there is no primary target, this follow-up will hit a random enemy instead. This can only happen once per turn.This one Eidolon fully solidifies March 8th's position as a near-universally applicable character. Being able to be paired with damn near anyone and see strong benefits for herself is invaluable on its own, but also being able to play into specific team settings and action verbs pushes her over the edge. Super Break, CRIT, follow-up \u2014 whatever you want, you can do it. She's just that good.E4 will grant March 5 Energy at the start of each turn, further expediting the acquisition of her already cheap and fast regenerating Ultimate, potentially letting March get more Enhanced Basics buffed by her Ultimate. Lastly, E6 will allow her Ultimate to additionally increase the CRIT DMG of her next Enhanced Basic ATK by 50%.This character is silly. It's silly and I love it. The poster woman of the game is now no longer limited to being a niche Freeze support and decided 'Fine, I'll do it myself.\u2122' As mentioned, she has many great options for teammates and can be played pretty much anywhere so long as you're not sacrificing some other pivotal piece of your team's puzzle. The biggest downside is that you can't have a one-size-fits-all build; if you want to do a dedicated Super Break setup after building for CRIT, you'll need to make some slight adjustments before you can pop off again, but as far as downsides go, it's really not a big deal at all. Please note that I say Super Break here; March doesn\u2019t really work as a Breaker without the Harmony Trailblazer.Even better is that because she's so SP-positive, you can freely make use of really SP-negative supports like Bronya and take full advantage of both kits. You can pair March with Gallagher and this lets March gain lots of points of Charge very quickly thanks to the frequent actions of Gallagher and lets both of them quickly and easily Break enemies to deal even more damage, and this works in both CRIT and Super Break, and with Bronya\u2019s Action Advance on top of that, you can give Gallagher a crazy amount of actions, thus granting March even more points of Charge. Robin also fits into this category and her kit is similarly synergistic, providing plenty of damage buffs, bonus damage, and of course her signature party-wide Action Advance.Making a follow-up user your Shifu, such as Topaz, Ratio, Yunli, or Clara, will construct an incredibly strong and accessible follow-up team that can easily destroy enemies; the large amount of follow-up actions will give March many points of Charge quite quickly, and the associated Paths of the aforementioned characters means March gets the additional damage instances on her Enhanced Basic.Or maybe you want to make your 4-star Wind Dan Heng the Shifu, or some other DPS character like Herta or Himeko, and you just want to see enemies disappear for no extra SP cost. You can do that, too.Your Imagination really is the limit. "

            "formatted": "March 7th is introduced as a shielder and counter-attacker, and remains competent at this role until the mid game. Beyond this, she finds a unique and potentially powerful niche as an AoE Freeze support, able to afflict enemies with Crowd Control and provide defensive utility by proxy. She has a strong enmity increasing effect on her Skills shield, and has the ability to cleanse allies upon applying said shield.As the poster-woman of the game, March 7th is introduced to us quite early and fills the role of sustain unit until players are introduced to Natasha a little later on. She was very competent at this role at the beginning, but over time has become less desirable in this specific facet. She is still good, but her team comps are more specialised these days and usually lean into her rather potent Freezing capability.March\u2019s Skill gives a single ally a shield for 57% of March\u2019s DEF plus 760 for 3 turns. If the ally\u2019s health is above 30% of their max, they will greatly draw enemies\u2019 aggro onto themselves. This is actually a really powerful single target shield, being even more than what Gepard\u2019s Ultimate provides in terms of raw multiplier.This is more or less where the positives end for this Skill. While the shield is powerful, it costs a Skill Point, and teams are usually centred around the sustain unit being an SP generator for the more powerful damage dealers and supports to use on their important skills. The increased aggro ends up being a double-edged sword quite often, as it will result in the shield getting broken more quickly on average, leading to needing a quicker reapplication of said shield. The fact that it lasts for 3 turns at base is often a non-factor when enemies are capable of dealing many strong targeted hits in a short period.It\u2019s often more efficient for March to target herself with her Skill and attempt to draw enemies\u2019 attention away from the squishier targets in the party, though how successful this ends up being is entirely at the whim of the random number generator. Tingyun users will know what I\u2019m talking about. This is also more efficient from a shield standpoint, since shields essentially just give a health buffer to allies; shields take damage based on the shielded ally\u2019s DEF, meaning that particularly frail allies will actually get comparatively less value out of shields than high DEF allies, so someone that you are naturally inclined to build DEF on like March herself will have a \u2018stronger shield\u2019, technically.March\u2019s Talent is dependent on shielded allies. When a shielded ally is attacked, March will immediately counter the attacking enemy with a follow-up attack, dealing up to 100% ATK, and this can happen 2 times between March\u2019s turns. How very disappointing that this counter does not have any natural DEF scaling to it. In fact, none of March\u2019s offensive abilities have anything to do with her DEF. Considering later sustain options like Lynx or Fu Xuan have HP scaling and so even their Basic ATK has HP scaling instead of ATK scaling, it makes March look even more like a product of the early landscape of the game. The most positive thing to say about this Talent is that each counter contributes 10 Energy towards March\u2019s Ultimate.Speaking of which, March\u2019s Ultimate is actually very much worth your attention. She deals 150% ATK to all enemies on the field, and there is a 50% base chance for them to be Frozen for 1 turn. This is invaluable\u2026 when the Freeze actually lands. A 50% base chance is nothing short of pitiful, especially since it makes all subsequent Effect Hit Rate scale off of this base value. It is entirely on purpose though, as Freeze is one of the most debilitating Crowd Control effects in the game, and having even somewhat consistent application of it can result in making encounters complete jokes.The Ultimate also has a fairly average Energy cost of 120, meaning it is not too difficult to have this up quite frequently, especially if March herself is getting attacked, something that is similarly not too challenging to orchestrate thanks to her Skill\u2019s aggro increase. Freeze can completely invalidate certain enemies if you use it tactically, and this utility can help offset the lack of a solid sustain unit\u2019s kit.Major Traces are rather straightforward. A2 will allow the application of her Shield to also cleanse 1 debuff from allies, allowing March to retain some useful utility in her back pocket should the need arise. A4 will extend the duration of the Shield to 4 turns, something that as mentioned prior will very rarely come up unless you are denying the enemy any turns at all due to Freeze, at which point this loops back around into being largely useless again.A6 is where the money is. It increases the Ultimate\u2019s base chance to Freeze enemies by 15%, for a new base chance of 65%. This is a small but extremely significant bump to the likelihood of Freezing enemies, as this makes all Effect Hit Rate stats worth substantially more. This does have the consequence of making March\u2019s powerful Freeze focused build inaccessible until much later on into the game, but it acts as a nice transition into said build, as around that point March\u2019s solo sustain capabilities take a nosedive.March\u2019s Eidolons are not super impactful barring the first one. E1 will regenerate 6 Energy for March every time she Freezes a target with her Ultimate. This greatly improves the uptime on March\u2019s Ultimate and depending on investment level and luck, can result in March keeping enemies near permanently Frozen, often completely eliminating any risk they might have posed. If seeking to actively use March as a Freeze support, this Eidolon should absolutely be on your radar. E4 can also provide more Energy via more counters but is less impactful than E1 for pure Energy gains.E6 seems tantalising but you have to really think about how much healing 4% of a character\u2019s Max HP per turn is. If you thought \u2018that doesn\u2019t really seem like that much\u2019, you\u2019re correct! It\u2019s near meaningless and does not do anywhere near enough to offset March\u2019s weaknesses.Because of how March\u2019s kit interacts with itself, she is a very SP intensive sustain unit, and even when played as a Freeze support she is quite greedy with SP, wanting to use more to get her Ultimate back faster. As a result of this, March\u2019s team comps are usually highly specialised so as to accommodate the increased SP consumption that she has. This leads to more obvious choices like Jingliu or Blade who do not consume much SP at all, but those characters have far better team setups that do not include March 7th. There\u2019s also the rather glaring question of \u2018why inflict enemies with Crowd Control if you can just kill them?\u2019 and to that I say \u2018no, you\u2019re right, actually\u2019.Death is the ultimate Crowd Control. What\u2019s already dead cannot harm you (no, the kamikaze enemies don\u2019t count, don\u2019t be a pedant). As with Preservation Trailblazer, many of the same concerns and criteria arise with March 7th, namely that by including her in your team, you are attempting to lose less; if you\u2019re bringing March along for either reason, sustain or Freeze, your team is likely already in dire straits, and so this is simply a way of buying yourself more time to hopefully kill the enemy before they kill you.For players concerned with optimisation, it\u2019s a safe bet to say that, at least as of the time of writing this, there is never a situation in which March 7th is a more optimal teammate choice over someone else. Enemies very rarely lose the battle of attrition, and even when they do, you\u2019re unlikely to come out unscathed either. In scenarios like Memory of Chaos where you have both a cycle limit as well as the requirement to have everyone be alive at the end, March may be able to facilitate the latter, but won\u2019t do much of anything about expediting enemy expirations, even if invested very well.\u00a0However if she is well invested, she\u2019s also rarely a terrible choice, so it\u2019s difficult to fault the player whichever way they choose to go. March\u2019s kit makes her quite versatile and depending on the exact level of investment, she can easily pivot from one gameplan to the other; combat going well and don\u2019t need to shield? Enjoy endlessly Freezing the enemy while restoring SP; things getting a bit grim? You have her shield to fall back on.There is also some potential in future for March to become a key component of DoT teams due to how Freeze interacts with that mechanic. Freeze will make an enemy skip their turn and will Action Advance their next turn greatly, thus increasing the number of turns they take within a given time. This also makes the enemy take DoT twice in quick succession, so if the DoT is able to be reapplied quickly, the addition of Freeze can actually increase the rate of DoT damage quite significantly. This is more hypothetical right now as the only really powerful DoT teams revolve entirely around Kafka, and without a dedicated DoT support, there isn\u2019t really a team slot for March at present. But it could happen.Otherwise, dedicated Crowd Control doesn\u2019t really have a place at the moment. Until such a time comes about, March 7th is a \u2018lose less\u2019 unit who can find surprising use in many scenarios, even if she is ultimately almost always fated to be replaced by stronger and more precisely picked teammates. Still, she is someone you may wish to have ready to go as there are really very few easily accessible Ice units, and she really ruins Ice weak enemies\u2019 days."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Misha is a 4-star Destruction character. He is an interesting hybrid of a secondary damage dealer and support character. His Ultimate gains the ability to deal extra hits based on the amount of SP consumed across the team, with each hit increasing its damage. Each hit also has a chance to Freeze the enemy it hits. He can achieve this damage without consuming much SP if needed, and his control effects can vastly increase the survivability of a team if built for the Freeze.This bellboy is certainly an intriguing character.SP-consuming His kit seems a little confused at first but it hides some potentially intriguing power. Make no mistake, this is not the next Qingque or Xueyi or Sampo or... any of those, but he's not without value. Misha is very much meant to be played alongside other SP consuming DPS characters; we've had characters that can be used in dual-carry setups, but this is the first that is outright screaming at you to do so. I am not responsible for any mental anguish sustained from trying to play this guy as a hypercarry, you have been warned.Misha's Ultimate is the big thing here. It works somewhat similarly to Jing Yuan's Lightning-Lord \u2014 relax let me explain. It is a Bounce ability and has 3 hits by default. This can go up to as many as 10 hits in one Ultimate, with each hit being single-target and dealing up to 60% ATK. Misha targets one enemy for the first hit to land on, and then the remaining hits will each land on a random enemy. After the Ultimate ends, the Hits Per Action will reset back to 3.This leads to a potential 600% ATK across all hits, which is very impressive damage. The Toughness damage also gets pretty ridiculous, with 30 for the first hit and 15 for all subsequent ones, resulting in a total Toughness damage of 165. Each hit also has a 20% base chance to Freeze the enemy it hits before the damage goes through, meaning this has a surprisingly good chance of Freezing targets despite the low base chance. Considering his Ultimate only has an Energy cost of 100, this is pretty impressive.Misha's Talent also helps facilitate the Energy cost, and is what increases the Hits Per Action. Whenever an ally consumes 1 Skill Point, the Hits Per Action of his next Ultimate increases by 1 and Misha additionally restores up to 2 Energy. This is the line that basically tells you explicitly 'don't play him by himself'. It contributes a fair bit to getting more frequent Ultimates, and is especially recommended to try and make use of to increase the number of hits his Ultimate actually does.Misha's Skill is a standard Blast AoE dealing 200% ATK to the main target and 80% ATK to adjacent foes. This also increases the number of hits of his next Ultimate by 1. This Skill actually increases the number of hits by 2 thanks to Misha being able to trigger his own Talent.Misha's A2 increases the base chance of the Ultimate's first hit Freezing the target by 80%, resulting in a new base chance of 100%. This is huge for Freeze value as Freeze is almost always gatekept at 65% base chance or below because of its powerful control effect. A4 will grant Misha 60% Effect Hit Rate for the duration of his Ultimate, offering a sizeable consistency increase for the Freeze, and A6 increases Misha's CRIT DMG by 30% when dealing damage to Frozen enemies.This creates a bit of an interesting game plan where Misha is wholly defined by his Ultimate. Making the most out of it *should* be easy but because it's a Bounce ability, that part quite simply is not up to you. If there is only one enemy on the field, Misha can definitely ruin their day without issue, but the very moment there is a second enemy on the field, RNG take the wheel. The Toughness damage is always very appreciated and can help to offset any failed Freeze rolls from his actual Ultimate, but it's still not particularly enjoyable to watch the luggage fall on the one enemy you do not care about harming.Going all in damage for Misha is definitely the easiest way to get big numbers from his Ultimate, but he doesn't necessarily provide any extra value beyond that; a well-optimised team with the strong favourable supports can quite easily lead to more damage than you'd get by including Misha, so really he's in this limbo state of being between a secondary DPS and a support character.Going for Energy Regeneration Rate and Effect Hit Rate can allow him to more consistently get Ultimates to roll for more Freezes. This is a potentially intriguing option for DoT-centric teams, as when enemy units unfreeze, they take a turn to do so and their next turn gets Advanced a fair bit, significantly increasing the amount of DoT ticks they take in a given timespan. Again, the limiting factor here is the randomness in his Ultimate's targeting, and even then, it's a bit of a tall ask for a secondary damage dealer, especially when that slot could be occupied by a character like Herta or Pela.This leads onto the next point: Misha is dismal in AoE. His Blast Skill does not have the most compelling multiplier and only hits 3 targets at most, and his Ultimate's targeting method will just not help you in the slightest against lots of enemies due to each individual hit being single-target damage.There is some really strange tech that a slightly unhinged friend of mine suggested, and that's to go all in on the Freeze and go sustainless. This is a crazy idea, but if you also supplement this with a unit like Welt who can also apply crowd control unconditionally, honestly I could see it working, but you are certifiably insane if you try this. Even just mentioning this to you can classify as an infohazard, and I will not apologise because it's extremely funny to me. Live your best life, what can I say.Misha's Eidolons do have some interesting potential as well. E1 additionally increases the number of hits of his Ultimate based on the number of enemies on the field, up to 5 extra hits. This leads to a new maximum hit count of 15 against 5 enemies, but again, Misha in AoE is a no-go. If you land all 15 hits against a single enemy, you may well be the luckiest individual on the planet. E2 is also valuable as it gives each hit of his Ultimate a 24% base chance to reduce that target's DEF by 16% for 3 turns, giving him some additional support utility, though do keep in mind that the Freeze tech that's beneficial for DoT damage is also detrimental for debuff duration as it will run out faster as well.E4 is highly intriguing as it increases the DMG *multiplier* for each hit of the Ultimate by 6%, meaning the Ultimate can at this point go up to a total multiplier of 990% ATK \u2014 1062% ATK factoring in the Trace levels from E3. That's a lot! Add in E6, giving Misha a 30% DMG boost during his Ultimate, and you've got LETHAL LUGGAGE\u2122. E6 also restores 1 SP for the team the next time Misha uses his Skill after his Ultimate, thus providing even more support power.Do you see why he's weird now? Being a hybrid of multiple roles is quite tricky to do well because usually you're either insanely powerful, or rather underwhelming. Misha seems to lean more towards the latter, but I get this sense that there is untapped potential in his kit. Science requires experimentation, so if you're willing to give Misha a shot, you may end up pleasantly surprised.In any case, I would say that Misha is perfectly fine. He is a fine character, and is understandably less desirable to invest into compared to other verifiably powerful 4-stars and especially 5-stars. Perhaps over time this will change as his setups get explored more.He's just a boy. He's just a goofy lil' boy, having a goofy ol' time. He also seems chronically late, something that I could never relate to... Ever. Stop laughing\u2014"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Natasha is a free healer unit given out during the events of Jarilo-VI. She specialises in healing over time with her Skill and AoE healing with her Ultimate. She has the lowest cost Ultimate in the game at 90, allowing high uptime on her AoE healing, and she also has high bonuses to Outgoing Healing. Despite this, Natasha struggles to deal with end game scenarios and is largely outclassed by other sustain units.A pivotal figure during the initial events on Jarilo-VI, Natasha is given out to players for free right around the point the game\u2019s difficulty starts to noticeably rise. It\u2019s very likely that this is the first sustain unit that players obtain, unless their starter banner 5-star was either Bailu or Gepard.Much has changed since the initial review was written. Back then, Natasha was the only other healer in the game besides Bailu, and the late game landscape was quite a bit less hectic than it tends to be now. With many more sustain units in the game than before, Natasha has unfortunately not aged well in regards to her performance, and there are even cases of players opting for an extra Harmony or Nihility support instead of Natasha in their teams, going for an all-or-nothing approach because Natasha just struggles to keep people alive.Natasha\u2019s Skill restores a single ally\u2019s health by up to 10.5% of Natasha\u2019s Max HP plus 280, and additionally grants them a heal over time for 7.2% of Nat\u2019s Max HP plus 192. This regen will apply its heal at the start of the ally\u2019s turn and lasts for 2 turns. Her Ultimate heals all allies for 13.8% of Natasha\u2019s Max HP plus 368, and has a very low Energy cost of 90.These healing values are decent, but much of the power of Natasha\u2019s Skill is concentrated into the regen effect, meaning it can come too late to be meaningful. It\u2019s also not possible to apply this healing any other way besides using her Skill, meaning you need to expend a Skill Point to do so.Sustain characters have become pretty widely accepted to be SP positive units, sometimes spending SP themselves but mostly restoring more than they consume so that your other support characters and damage dealers have enough SP to use their important actions. Having this Skill also be single-target means that it can become very costly to sustain the whole team. Natasha\u2019s Ultimate also may have a low cost but with nothing else going for it beyond the raw healing, it\u2019s almost necessary for its cost to be so low.\u00a0Natasha\u2019s Talent will increase her Outgoing Healing by 50% when healing allies whose HP is at or below 30%, and this works for regen effects too. This is a huge amount of extra healing, but it requires allies to be at 30% or below and still be alive to receive said healing. That is literally red health territory which is an uncomfortably low amount of health to be at, and usually it\u2019ll end up being reached during an enemy\u2019s turn meaning you need to have Natasha\u2019s Ultimate available to get the Emergency healing off, which can often lead to holding her Ultimate for that circumstance. Holding any Ultimate is already painful but holding a 90 Energy Ultimate for the sole purpose of being able to actually sustain a teammate in an emergency feels utterly horrendous.The 30% HP threshold for the Talent\u2019s boost is too harsh in the current oversaturated era of endless enemy AoE attacks. Natasha just doesn\u2019t have the tools to keep up with the enemy onslaught, at least not without completely bankrupting your team\u2019s SP reserves. Worse still is that Natasha cannot really make up for that deficit with Eidolons, meaning this is the best you\u2019re going to get.A2 gives Natasha\u2019s Skill a 1 debuff cleanse, something that is largely intrinsic for the newer healer units. A4 increases Natasha\u2019s Outgoing Healing further by 10%, and A6 increases the duration of her Skill\u2019s regen effect by an extra turn, for a new duration of 3 turns. None of these particularly improve the ease of use in harder content where it\u2019s actually important to have a good sustain unit.In comparison to the other sustain units, Natasha requires too much effort on the part of the player to make use of, and there are now more readily accessible units that do a better job. Lynx in particular is an almost complete and direct upgrade over Natasha, and as a 4-star is relatively easy to acquire eventually, either from warps or from Starlight Exchange.It is almost incomparable how much easier it is for Lynx to deal with the AoE-heavy enemy onslaught at far lower investment; Lynx has an AoE cleanse on her Ultimate by default and all her healing will result in a regen effect, meaning it is far easier for her to sustain the entire team without necessarily needing to use SP. Couple that with Lynx\u2019s far stronger Skill effect of increasing a character\u2019s Max HP and increasing the healing from Lynx\u2019s Talent regen in addition to direct healing, and you\u2019ve got a superior unit, no matter how you cut it.Comparing Natasha to 5-stars is pretty much pointless as they all vastly surpass Natasha in pretty much all aspects. Natasha\u2019s previous only competitor in Bailu has such a huge advantage against the current landscape of enemies that the fact that Bailu lacks any source of cleanse is a lot less impactful when the raw healing is enough to sustain through painful enemy damage over time. It\u2019s still one of the huge negatives of Bailu, but Invigoration not only greatly surpasses Natasha\u2019s overall healing throughput, it also provides a Max HP increase alongside true damage reduction, and the mechanism for its healing is characters taking a hit, making it far stronger as both a reactive and a preventative measure.Even in the cases where there are people showing full free-to-play teams with Natasha involved, she is never the reason for that team\u2019s success. It is always the other units who are so well invested to the point where Natasha\u2019s inclusion is largely cosmetic.Of course, you can still make Natasha work despite her drawbacks. For many players, Natasha will be their only sustain unit for a while until they get the Path of Preservation unlocked for the Trailblazer. Preservation Trailblazer does a phenomenal job at covering for the weaknesses of Natasha as their passive shielding helps mitigate damage and allow Natasha to actually make much better use of her powerful Talent; allies can stay at lower health values for longer without as much fear of outright death, so there\u2019s more time to utilise the strong bonus to Outgoing Healing.This introduces a new drawback of now your team has two sustain units and has become a double defensive team. In harder late game content, this puts a lot more strain on the remaining two units in the team to deal the damage you need. Preservation Trailblazer themselves can actually be an acceptable solo sustain against quite a few specific enemy lineups, so Natasha again can struggle to be relevant.If heavily invested into, Natasha can reach a point where her Skill and Ultimate are virtually full heals for lower Max HP teammates, which can allow you to get through some of the harder content as long as you\u2019re prepared to hold onto some SP for Natasha to use\u2026 But again, the issue isn\u2019t just the amount of healing she does, it\u2019s the very mechanism that delivers that healing. By the time you invest in Natasha enough for her to reach this point in the late game, there\u2019s a very strong possibility of you already having another sustain unit, at which point you should immediately pivot to using them and shelve Natasha.If you just like her a lot and want to use her for her then that is, as always, entirely valid, but if you\u2019re looking to start tackling Memory of Chaos you should be aware of the issues that you may encounter."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Pela is a universally applicable debuffer support that Shreds enemy DEF and can dispel buffs from enemies. Her DEF Shred is AoE and lasts for 2 turns, allowing pretty much every damage dealer character to take advantage of it. As a 4-star unit, Pela is the most accessible source of DEF Shred in the game and is very often found among the strongest teams in the game for this reason.Definitely not an underage drinker, Pela is a pretty terrifying support character. Because of the way that DEF reduction works, it\u2019s one of the few things in the game where having more of it is actually always beneficial. By virtue of simply existing and occasionally using her Ultimate, Pela can increase your team\u2019s overall damage by a significant amount.So let\u2019s start there, shall we? Pela\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 100% ATK to all enemies and has a 100% base chance to inflict Exposed onto all enemies. Exposed enemies have their DEF reduced by up to 40% for 2 turns. Big. Huge. Wonderful. I could end the review here to be honest, this is pretty much all anyone cares about when it comes to Pela anyway, but I won\u2019t because there\u2019s still more to say.Stacking this Ultimate\u2019s effects with other sources of DEF reduction or DEF ignore will compound the effects further, resulting in even greater increases to damage dealt. This can be achieved through quite a few ways, but the big one that comes to mind is the Genius of Brilliant Stars Relic Set. Did you know how good this set is? It\u2019s pretty good, you know. The 4 piece giving a 10% DEF ignore to everything is already pretty good, but increasing to 20% ignore against Quantum-weak foes is astounding. It\u2019s no surprise that Pela often finds her way onto teams with Quantum characters.Now, just because stacking more DEF reduction is good doesn\u2019t mean that you wouldn\u2019t benefit more from pursuing other methods of increasing damage after a point; it\u2019s all relative to what your chosen damage dealers are after and what enemies you\u2019re going against. A not-so-subtle reminder that the game with team-building elements in it requires team-building.Pela\u2019s Skill deals up to 210% ATK to a single enemy and will remove 1 buff from them. Extremely underrated ability as it completely ruins the Mara-struck soldiers and Sanctus Medicus Shape Shifters pesky buffs. It also greatly screws over buff reliant enemies like the Searing Prowler, though keep in mind it\u2019ll only work on buffs that don\u2019t have the Unremovable tag next to them.I know that by looking at the damage multiplier of Pela\u2019s Skill, some of you are going \u2018yo, so is DPS pela viable?!\u2019 to which I say, relax, it\u2019s not that deep. Pela is and will always be a support character. If you are finding yourself crutching on the absolutely insignificant damage that Pela is bringing to your team, you have far greater problems to worry about. I am saying this now because Pela\u2019s Eidolons are also hilarious in how hard they bait players into thinking damage Pela is a thing. It isn\u2019t, so desist.Pela\u2019s Talent will restore up to an additional 10 Energy if the enemy is debuffed after her attack. This only works on a per attack basis, so you don\u2019t get 50 Energy back for debuffing 5 enemies. Even still, 10 Energy back after using her Ultimate is extremely significant, as her Ultimate already has a below average cost of 110. With some Energy Regeneration Rate in your build, Pela\u2019s going to be getting her Ultimate back at blazing speed.Her Bonus Traces are also largely trolling you. A2 increases her DMG dealt to debuffed enemies by 20%, and A6 increases the DMG of her next attack by 20% after her Skill removes a buff from an enemy. Remember what I said, this does not make her a dps. It does not. This is not some big brain play to get you to think \u2018oh maybe it\u2019s actually good\u2019 please just listen to the words I\u2019m saying. A4 is actually tangibly useful for not just Pela but her whole team, increasing everyone\u2019s Effect Hit Rate by 10% while she\u2019s alive and on the field.There are only two major Eidolons worth considering, and that\u2019s E1 and E4. E1 grants 5 Energy whenever an enemy is defeated, contributing to Pela\u2019s already good Energy economy, and E4 will allow her Skill to reduce a target\u2019s Ice RES by 12% for 2 turns, offering yet another damage increase for her Ice based damage dealers. E5 is actually also very significant since it raises the level of your Ultimate and Talent, increasing the DEF Shred percentage and Energy return respectively.Pela is quite SP positive due to the complete lack of a need to use her Skill \u2014 it\u2019s a choice you can choose to make depending on circumstances, such as having a surplus of SP anyway, needing that little bit of extra Energy for her Ultimate, or to really ruin the day of a buff-happy enemy. Outside of those situations, you can pretty happily Basic ATK indefinitely. Especially with the Before the Tutorial Mission Starts Light Cone, Pela can stay fully SP positive while also managing to get pretty frequent 2 turn Ultimates, leading to full uptime or near enough that on her AoE DEF Shred. Even if you don\u2019t have that event exclusive Light Cone, there are plenty of other great alternatives available because praise be to Nihility, I guess. Only the most based of Aeons says they don\u2019t care about having consistent theming, thank you very cool, IX.With her abilities the way they are, Pela can quite easily slot into pretty much any team at all, and is often even one of the best options anyway due to her extreme SP positivity. Without a need to build any specific stats either, it\u2019s well within reason to make Pela both tanky and fast to guarantee great team SP economy as well as consistent Ultimates. This is especially true for a fast Pela, since her debuff only ticks down on enemy turns, so as long as Pela is faster than the enemies, you end up giving yourself more time to regain her Ultimate while still maintaining full uptime on the debuff on enemies.If you don\u2019t have Pela, get Pela. This is not a request, this is a Belobog order. \u2018If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight!\u2019 Sun Tzu said that, and I\u2019d say he knows a little more about fighting than you do, pal, because he invented it\u2014"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Qingque is an odd but endearing character. She\u2019s a unit that makes a somewhat questionable first impression, but she blooms into one of the most formidable and self-sufficient damage dealers in the game.Qingque has her primary source of damage come from a loose RNG mechanic. Her talent has her randomly draw tiles on each ally turn, 1 per turn, with 3 possible suits. At 4 perfectly matched tiles, her basic attack becomes enhanced, becoming a blast AoE and dealing vastly increased damage, while also getting an ATK% boost, up to a colossal 72% bonus ATK at max Trace level. If you are not matched, your basic attack will discard 1 tile with the lowest tile matches. This Enhanced Basic attack hits extremely hard, especially later on, but comes with the additional caveat that it will not recover a skill point like other Basic attacks.Her Skill immediately draws 2 tiles and grants a damage increase until the end of the turn, and immediately grants an extra turn where you can choose to draw again, or exit with a Basic attack. Drawing again will stack the damage increase, up to 4 times in total. This is where the main gameplay loop comes in, you cycle tiles with her Skill until you\u2019re matched, and then toss out your Enhanced Basic attack for massive damage.Now, it\u2019s entirely possible for you to use Qingque\u2019s Skill 5 times in a row, thus using up literally all of your skill points in the process, and still not having 4 matching tiles. However, this is in practice really quite rare to see, and you should only ever use her Skill 4 times in a row since the DMG% only stacks up to 4 times anyway. You can also circumvent this bad luck through careful usage of her Ultimate, detailed a bit later.Her ultimate guarantees an Enhanced Basic attack after using it, allowing you to strategically skip entire tile searches and get potentially back to back Enhanced Basics, but the Ultimate has an absurd energy cost, one of the absolute highest in the game. Worse still, using her Skill doesn\u2019t recover any energy for Qingque, so her energy regeneration comes exclusively from her Basic attacks and Enhanced Basic attacks, meaning it takes a lot longer on average to get her Ultimate than for pretty much any other character.Now, it\u2019s important to mention that Qingque is a very late bloomer. Her scalings are very impressive but she requires a lot of investment to get to the stage where they start really having an impact, especially due to the stacking nature of her Skill. Because of this, Qingque is actually somewhat weak by comparison in the early game, and this can contribute to incorrectly assuming she\u2019s not worth investing in. Her Talents need to be levelled up a lot to really bring out the best of her, and gaining access to her Bonus Traces provides noticeable performance spikes; for example, her first big spike in power comes at A4 when she can reach level 60, which is really quite late compared to many other damage dealers.Her Bonus Traces do some good work to alleviate these early concerns. A2 refunds a Skill Point on the first Skill usage of a fight, meaning it\u2019s a one-time benefit in an encounter. At first glance this doesn\u2019t sound too impressive, and at second glance you\u2019d realise your first glance was mostly correct, so really her A2 exists to give her more of a head start in an encounter and little else.Her A4 is where the money is. It adds an extra 10% to the DMG% bonus of her Skill. This is per Skill usage, meaning at 4 stacks, it\u2019s an extra 40% DMG boost on top of what she\u2019s already getting. You can think of this Bonus Trace as injecting bonus levels into her Skill\u2019s Trace. This means at max Trace level, 4 stacks of Qingque\u2019s Skill will be giving her 152% bonus damage on her next attack. Coupled with the 72% bonus ATK from her Talent if you have 4 matching tiles, Qingque\u2019s about to decimate whatever she\u2019s looking at.A6 increases Qingque\u2019s speed for 1 turn after using her enhanced basic attack, which helps her get back in the fight sooner to start recovering more tiles and energy. It\u2019s a nice bonus to have, but due to Qingque\u2019s slightly below average speed stat, this isn\u2019t that impactful on its own.The ratio of skill points used to output value is exceedingly high with Qingque\u2019s skill, because the potential damage bonuses she gets are astronomical. This is especially true since as mentioned earlier, you can use her Ultimate to circumvent bad luck and also take advantage of Qingque\u2019s Skill\u2019s damage bonuses. This is because Qingque\u2019s Skill counts as an Extra Action, and all Ultimates also count as Extra Actions.\u00a0So by using this knowledge, if you have Qingque\u2019s Ultimate available, you can freely spend SP to draw tiles. If you\u2019re lucky and get her Enhanced Basic, then you can throw it out and instantly use her Ultimate to take advantage of the stacked bonus damage from her Skill and carry it over onto her Ultimate, making it also hit significantly harder and guaranteeing the Enhanced Basic attack for her next turn.\u00a0Now in this next example, you spend up to 4 SP drawing tiles and have yet to get her Enhanced Basic, so what you can do is use her Ultimate as soon as you realise this. Using the Extra Action that is her Ultimate means the damage boosts also affect the Ultimate, dealing increased damage, but because the Ultimate is an Extra Action, it is still Qingque\u2019s turn, meaning you get to use the guaranteed Enhanced Basic from the Ultimate that also gets boosted by the Skill\u2019s damage bonuses. This even has the added benefit of giving her a head start towards her next Ultimate.This may seem complicated at first, but once you realise how this works and can recognise when this comes up, you\u2019ll very quickly start to understand that Qingque\u2019s \u201cRNG issues\u201d are completely overblown and exaggerated. She\u2019s actually remarkably consistent when it counts, far more than anyone was really initially prepared for, especially myself.\u00a0Qingque also has a different playstyle where you mostly focus on Basic attacking with her generating SP for a different dedicated damage dealer. This ends up working because her Talent draws tiles on its own on each Ally turn, so it\u2019s still possible for her to get Enhanced Basics over time with no SP expenditure or from her Ultimate. It\u2019s a viable alternative for if another character better matches an enemy weakness, or if you know you need that SP for other purposes.These two playstyles are not mutually exclusive; you can very easily adjust and adapt on the fly based on your team\u2019s SP needs, making Qingque actually quite the flexible unit as well. Just be aware that Qingque really pays more like a Destruction character than an Erudition one, in that she has phenomenal single-target damage but also has some more limited AoE damage as well.\u00a0Qingque is already fantastic at base, but has two Eidolons that notably improve her performance. E4 gives a small chance for a phantom follow-up attack to occur after using a Basic Attack or Enhanced Basic attack, potentially allowing her to double-dip into the big damage bonuses she can accrue. E6 allows her to actually recover a skill point with her Enhanced Basic attack. The combination of these two Eidolons propel Qingque to a frightening height where she can do zero-cycle Memory of Chaos clears without really batting an eye.As evidenced by the length of this review, Qingque is quite the complicated character. She is not meant to be left on Auto, and to do so is to squander her potential. If you find her play style is too frustrating or too complicated, or if you\u2019re seeking characters that can be left on Auto, Qingque is probably not the character for you and I suggest looking elsewhere. Additionally, without her Ultimate, the chances of getting completely shafted by RNG are non-zero, meaning you need to be prepared to lose the dice roll on rare occasions.\u00a0But because of everything discussed combined, Qingque is still quite the consistent and powerful character. If anything, she looks like she\u2019s only going to continue to get better into the future.She is absolutely worth your time."

            "formatted": "Additional notes for sub-statsSPEED:Unlike some other supports, Robin doesn't \"need\" Speed as during her Ultimate her Speed is fixed at 90 and she spends a good amount of time within that state. She also doesn't rely solely on her own actions for generating Energy and in many cases generates more Energy from her team and taking damage than herself. For these reasons, Speed is not essential.It is recommended however that you build enough Speed on your Robin so that she always takes the first action in combat and applies her 50% damage increase to all allies. Thanks to her 25% action advance bonus ability it doesn't take much for Robin to outspeed even the fastest team setups. Generally, 120/121 Speed will allow you to outspeed allies at around 160 Speed (you can use even less Speed than this if you're running a slow team and a non-speed scaling planar).If you're using supports that similarly start with action advances like Robin you may want to look into running Sprightly Vonwacq to ensure she always moves first. Outside of ensuring Robin moves first, Speed is no longer essential but can still hold value in allowing Robin quicker actions outside of her ultimate which may or may not be the difference between landing an Ultimate at a more opportune time or gaining another one entirely.ATK% & DMG%Robin's biggest buffs and all her damage can be scaled with ATK%, making it by far her best stat and the one you should focus on stacking as much as possible of.If you're interested in seeking out more personal damage for Robin though, DMG% and PHYS% can in many cases be more valuable than ATK%. Many Robin builds end up with 180%-200%+ increased ATK% easily and the only source of DMG% Robin has naturally is her skill which grants her 50% (+ whatever she can manage from her Light Cone). This means the DMG% multiplier ends up being much lower compared to ATK%.For maximizing damage experimenting with a PHYS% orb or other sources of DMG% can help you gain more from your Robin as long as you're not giving up too much in the form of ATK and losing out on Robin's supportive capabilities.Energy Recharge%Exactly how much Energy you need to achieve casting Robin's Ultimate every 1, 2 or 3 actions will change based on your team, the fight, and random chance. As the more your team is able to hit the more energy Robin will gain, the more the enemy attacks, and the more of their attacks are AoE, the higher chance Robin has to gain substantial energy from taking damage. And of course, based on luck she may or may not get hit by more or less attacks. For all these reasons, it's not possible to say exactly how much Energy Regeneration you need but getting as much as possible without sacrificing Robin's personal damage and team buffs is advised."

            "formatted": "Robin is an exceptionally potent Harmony support. She provides highly competitive teamwide buffs at relatively high SP efficiency, while also contributing a very significant amount of her own damage through her Ultimate. She possesses the highly coveted ability to Action Advance teammates, only she is capable of Advancing the entire party, excluding herself. Her method of contributing damage cannot be interrupted by enemy Crowd Control effects and is directly tied to how many attacks the team as a whole can launch, with even further benefits for follow-up-centric teams.I'll cut to the chase this time around, this is yet another unsurprising slam-dunk for Harmony. Robin is on a similar power level to that of Ruan Mei, being better in some particular specialized teams and worse in others. Even despite that, there is a fairly good amount of overlap where they can be used, and Robin may prove to be an even more enticing option for the practiced player. With that bar established, let's elaborate on why exactly Robin reaches these heights, starting with the less dramatic portion of her kit, her Skill. It's a simplistic teamwide DMG buff of up to 50%, lasting for 3 of Robin's turns. This makes it quite an efficient boost for the whole party as you're not having to constantly keep up a buff on specific teammates. Robin's Talent is also simple, providing a permanent CRIT DMG boost to the whole party of up to 20%. It also has the added effect of granting Robin 2 additional points of Energy whenever allies attack enemy targets.The iconic part of Robin's kit is her Ultimate. She brings an entire concert to life upon use, immediately Action Advancing all other characters by 100%, and Robin herself enters the Concerto state, increasing all allies' ATK by up to 22.8% of Robin's ATK plus a flat 200. She starts to sing and a countdown shows up in the Action Order bar, essentially acting as a way to keep track of when Robin's Concerto state will end. During Concerto, Robin has a fixed SPD of 90 with absolutely no way of affecting this; when the countdown ends, Robin will take her turn, but cannot be Action Advanced, Delayed, or affected by Crowd Control or SPD influencing effects.If you are familiar with how the likes of Bronya and Sparkle work, you may already understand why being able to instantly grant the entire rest of the party an immediate additional Action is so ridiculously powerful. You grant more total Actions over the course of a fight than you would otherwise be allowed, and can bring allies up into a cycle that's about to end, essentially cheating out extra time to finish the fight or potentially sparing yourself from a powerful enemy attack.Sending Robin to SPD purgatory by design may seem like a steep price to pay, especially since the cost of the Ultimate itself is a staggering 160 Energy, and this would definitely be the case were it not for the second part of the Ultimate. While Robin is in the Concerto state, in addition to the ATK increase and Action Advance, she will deal additional Physical DMG whenever any ally launches an attack against an enemy, dealing up to 120% ATK per attack action. This damage also has a fixed CRIT Rate of 100% and a fixed CRIT DMG of 150%.Now, in addition to the other benefits she's providing with her Ultimate, Robin is also dealing damage of her own, and let me tell you that it's very substantial \u2014 in other supports' reviews it's been mentioned that their damage output is 'non-negligible' meaning it's nice to have but shouldn't be likely to be a significant portion of the team's overall damage. This is absolutely not the case with Robin, her damage is absolutely a massive increase and is actually quite easy to account for.If upon reading 'per attack action' your mind immediately went to follow-up teams, you're right on the money. Any action that lands a hit on the enemy will cause Robin to chuck a treble-clef at the enemy, including Ultimates and especially follow-ups. The low SPD that the Concerto state enforces on Robin is therefore actually a boon, giving the team more opportunities to proc Robin's additional damage. Even better is that since her Skill's duration is based on Robin's own turns, she can keep a single Skill activation going for an incredibly long time, making her extremely SP efficient to boot, and of course thanks to her Talent, she is able to regain Energy even during the Concerto state.The steep Energy cost of the Ultimate is absolutely justified, and careful usage of it can result in downright illegal maneuvers against even the toughest enemies \u2014 heck, even haphazard usage is strong enough in pretty much all cases. It's unlikely that you will be able to keep up the Ultimate indefinitely even with outside sources of Energy like Turbulence effects, and even if you do regain enough to prolong the effects, you're usually better off waiting until the last character before Robin has acted before using Robin's Ultimate, as this is the most efficient way to utilise the 100% Action Advance the Ultimate provides. However, if you're pressed for time and overall Actions like in Pure Fiction, you may want to maximize how many Ultimates Robin can get off, in which case it's better not to wait.Robin's Bonus Ability Traces also tie into her powerful performance. The A2 will give Robin a 25% Action Advance at the beginning of a fight, making it much easier to use her Skill before any of your other DPS characters get their first actions off. A4 will improve upon the innate follow-up synergies by granting follow-up attacks a 25% CRIT DMG boost during the Concerto state, and A6 will make Robin's Skill regenerate an additional 5 Energy on use. A6 in particular can make it quite a compelling choice to use Robin's Skill even if she doesn't need to refresh it purely for the massive influx of Energy it provides.Talking about Eidolons for limited 5-star characters is becoming increasingly redundant as they all follow the same pattern for the most part. As always, absolutely no Eidolons are necessary for Robin to excel, and she is not rated with them in mind. E1 provides a teamwide 24% All-Type RES PEN while Robin is in the Concerto state, and E2 will also increase all allies' SPD by 16% also during Concerto, while also increasing the Energy gained from her Talent to 3. E4 will instantly dispel all Crowd Control debuffs on allies when they get Action Advanced by the Ultimate, and will also improve their Effect RES by 50% during Concerto. Finally, E6 makes Robin really put the 'Harm' in Harmony, giving herself 8 uses of a hyper-enhanced additional DMG instance during her Ultimate, having a 600% CRIT DMG bonus instead of the usual 150%, going back to the usual amount after 8 attacks have been launched and resetting the stack count when the Ultimate is used again. It, uh, destroys pretty much everything in the blink of an eye. Have fun with that, Anemone.Because of the unique way that Robin plays out, her stat requirements as a Harmony character are very non-standard; thanks to the Concerto state setting her SPD to a fixed value of 90, she doesn't really care about SPD that much beyond being able to get the first Action of a fight, something that is rather easy to achieve thanks to her A2 passive, meaning a paltry SPD value of around 120 is good enough in most cases unless your DPS character is a speed demon. Additionally, because the Concerto state\u2019s additional attacks have fixed CRIT values, literally any amount from stats or substats is entirely wasted. Robin cares almost exclusively about ATK, and can make very good use of it, meaning it's very reasonable to focus on defensive stats after you've hit the ATK and SPD values you were aiming for.Energy is a bit of a sore spot, not only because of the aforementioned high Energy cost of 160, but also because how much Energy exactly Robin will be getting depends entirely on the team you're running her with, as well as the enemies you happen to be facing. It's quite free-form and you'll have to get a feel for it for yourself, so the general recommendation is to get as much Energy Regeneration Rate as you can without it hindering Robin's supportive capabilities. For this reason, it's also recommended to place Robin in the middle of the team to increase the likelihood of her getting clipped by enemy AoE attacks for that sweet 'hit me' Energy \u2014 another good reason to invest in defensive stats. This makes Robin arguably the easiest support character to build in the entire game, almost laughably so. When pretty much every other support wants to be as fast as possible and aim for having around 160 SPD or even greater, the paltry requirements of Robin are a very, very welcome change of pace.In terms of teams, Robin is highly flexible. For clarity, Robin is not an exclusively follow-up centric support. She's giving Ruan Mei a run for her money in pretty much all teams that aren't explicitly Break focused. Having said that... Robin does see the greatest benefits in follow-up teams. Dr. Ratio, Topaz, and Aventurine all have easily accessed follow-up attacks that can frequently trigger Robin's extra DMG and self Energy restore, while also benefiting from the near-permanent 25% extra CRIT DMG offered exclusively to follow-up attacks, getting a total of 45% CRIT DMG from Robin just existing, really. Topaz especially will always be benefiting from this as all of her attacks count as follow-ups.Huohuo is also particularly noteworthy as a good general sustain to pair with Robin if one does not have Aventurine, as Huohuo's Ultimate restores a percentage of Energy to all other allies. With Robin having a Energy cost of 160, this results in a very significant amount of Energy coming back with just a single Huohuo Ultimate. The ATK buff provided by Huohuo will also naturally increase Robin's own damage output during the Concerto state. This is particularly amusing to see in the now classic Damage over Time (DoT) team with Kafka and Black Swan, where Robin feels surprisingly at home, mostly in part thanks to Kafka's extremely frequent and consistent follow-up and the rest due to DoT teams being naturally very SPD heavy in the first place. The sheer amount of ATK buffs in that team makes the DoT damage staggeringly high.If one does not have these other 5-star limited characters, Clara is also someone who benefits from Robin \u2014 extremely so, to the point where Robin could very well be a best-in-slot support for Clara moving forward. The only limit on how many follow-ups Clara can throw out is how often she can get hit, meaning in particularly enemy-dense encounters or against speed demon bosses, Clara can output a very impressive amount of damage when bolstered by Robin, and Robin can do much the same thanks to Clara. If you are of a\u2026 particularly driven nature, you can try assembling a team of alacritous assistants attempting to aid Robin's attacks, by which I mean: fast team makes Robin hit more, so more SPD is good. You'd be shifting the focus more onto Robin herself by trying to eke out as many additional hits from her Ultimate as possible, so Asta would see great value in this regard, especially as she herself offers a very powerful teamwide ATK buff that Robin can also benefit from. This support pairing works very well with a great many DPS characters and is highly accessible due to Asta being a free 4-star character. It's not the most recommended setup for more storied players with access to more limited 5-star characters, but it definitely does work, and it's funny when things go zoom.As I said in the beginning, Harmony stays winning, and Robin is another fantastic addition to the roster. I've made the analogy before of 'it's like comparing gold to platinum' when there's something great and something that's also great but slightly better, but when it comes to the Harmony characters, they\u2019re all so good that having any of them is going to be great for you. Sure there are cases where one shines more than the others, but for the overwhelming majority of people, it's the same picture. There are only winners in this race. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go listen to Robin's Ultimate song for 10 hours. It's a bop and everyone knows it."

Aim for a desirable Speed breakpoint next (134 minimum recommended). After achieving these goals stack more Break Effect to improve Ruan's burst damage or invest in more Speed or DEF% and HP% to make her more durable.SPEED: Ruan Mei, is a skill point positive support so stacking more Speed on her will assist with skill point generation. Unlike other supports though she can offer the full benefits of her kit without worrying about how fast she is compared to the rest of her team. Because of this until you achieve her Break requirements Speed is a lower priority.BREAK EFFECT: Thanks to Ruan's bonus ability - Candle Lights on Still Waters - she gains up to 36% increased damage for the whole team when at 180% Break Effect or higher. Ensuring this is the case is your number 1 priority when building Ruan. More Break Effect than this is still helpful, it will boost Ruan's damage contribution in fights offering even higher burst damage allowing for incredibly easy removal of smaller enemies thanks to her talent.Energy Recharge: To consistently achieve a 4-action rotation when using her Signature, Ruan requires an Energy Recharge rope, When using S5 Meshing Cogs or S5 Memories of the Past to consistently gain a 3-action rotation it's also required,Due to the power of her Ultimate, gaining Energy Recharge where it makes sense for your build and team comps is advised."

            "formatted": "Ruan Mei is an exceptional support character. She is able to effortlessly buff the whole team\u2019s DMG and increase everyone\u2019s Break Efficiency with her Skill, something no other character is currently able to do. Her Ultimate increases all allies\u2019 RES PEN and is able to delay the enemies again once their Weakness Break ends. She\u2019s even got free bonus Break damage from her Talent that activates whenever allies Break an enemy, and the Talent itself provides a small but permanent SPD boost to all other characters in the party.The definitely sane, definitely not megalomaniacal Genius Society member, Ruan Mei, is a fairly ridiculous character in the game. She is our very first support character to increase the Weakness Break Efficiency of characters; you know that one Nihility blessing in the Simulated Universe? Night Beyond Pyre, the one that increases Break Efficiency by 30%? Yeah, well, Ruan Mei can increase that by 50% and also have it permanently active.Ruan Mei\u2019s Skill gives her a buff called Overtone, lasting for 3 turns. This ticks down at the start of her turn. While she has Overtone, all allies\u2019 DMG increases by 32% and Weakness Break Efficiency increases by 50%. This is kind of absurd already given that the application of this buff is entirely effortless, and having it last for 3 turns means that Ruan Mei has plenty of time to recover the SP she spent setting it up and then some. Weakness Break Efficiency is exceedingly powerful. Enemies take slightly reduced damage from all sources while they are not Broken, and this gets removed once they do get Broken, so if you\u2019ve ever wondered why a Broken enemy seems to be taking so much more damage, this is why.\u00a0Usually, there is not a large window of opportunity to take advantage of this state, and it may be preferable to hold off on using big hitting abilities until after the enemy has recovered from Break so as to resume dealing Toughness damage. With this Skill\u2019s effects active, you not only get enemies into that state faster, but it\u2019s easier to repeatedly get them to that state even with weaker hitting attacks, meaning you\u2019re more able to land those huge hits during the enemies\u2019 most vulnerable period.Ruan Mei\u2019s Ultimate deploys a field for 2 turns, and this also ticks down at the start of her turn. While the field is active, all allies get 25% All-Type RES PEN. If you\u2019ve been around for a while, or if you\u2019re an avid user of Seele, you should understand how rare and powerful Resistance Penetration is by now. 25% is ridiculous, and with a 2-turn duration based on Ruan Mei\u2019s turns, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to abuse this to the player\u2019s benefit with faster characters or with turn manipulation.In addition to this, ally attacks within the field apply a debuff to enemies called Thanatoplum Rebloom to enemies they hit. This effect triggers when an enemy attempts to recover from Weakness Break, extending their Weakness Break and delaying their action by 20% of Ruan Mei\u2019s Break Effect plus 10%. This re-Break will also deal 50% of Ruan Mei\u2019s Ice Break DMG. This works in tandem with her Skill to just bully enemies; you Break them faster with the Break Efficiency and then get to keep them Broken for longer, all while benefiting from the DMG bonuses and RES PEN. Important to note that Thanatoplum Rebloom can only trigger again after the enemy has fully recovered from Weakness Break.\u00a0The buffs she provides are already highly impressive even without considering the bonus provided by the Break extension, but with her Talent she provides even more benefits, and she can even contribute some damage of her own. She permanently increases all other teammates\u2019 SPD by 10%, and whenever an ally Breaks an enemy, Ruan Mei will instantly deal damage equal to 120% of her Ice Break DMG. This is not a follow-up attack, this damage is inflicted alongside the Break damage of the ally inflicting Break.A 10% SPD boost is just about enough to be significant and to meet specific SPD thresholds for characters. However, being able to contribute Break damage without even needing to be the one to Break enemies is ridiculously good, especially as it\u2019s actually a higher multiplier if you let other allies do it for you; this solves the biggest problem with building for Break Effect which is that if you\u2019re not the one to Break enemies, that stat is functionally useless for you. For Ruan Mei, this is most assuredly not the case, so don\u2019t be surprised to be seeing light blue damage numbers in the five-digit range showing up alongside Breaks later on.It\u2019s clear by now that Ruan Mei benefits the Break playstyle significantly and also benefits from Break Effect% herself as she has so many ways to utilise it. With her Bonus Ability Traces, Ruan Mei reaches a new height that makes her supportive capabilities begin to approach the omnipresent power of Bronya. A2 increases all allies\u2019 Break Effect by 20%, and A4 will regenerate 5 Energy for Ruan Mei at the start of her turn.A6 is where the big money is; in combat, for every 10% Break Effect that Ruan Mei has that exceeds 120%, her Skill\u2019s DMG bonus increases by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 36% extra. That means that if you can reach at least 180% Break Effect, Ruan Mei\u2019s Skill is now providing a ridiculous 68% DMG bonus to all allies in addition to its already powerful 50% Break Efficiency. While it is no small feat to achieve such a high Break Effect stat, the mere fact that it\u2019s possible to do so puts Ruan Mei\u2019s supportive capabilities right at the top alongside Bronya and Tingyun.Eidolon-wise, it\u2019s complete overkill in all cases. E1 is great value because it also gives allies a 20% DEF ignore during the Ultimate, but again, it\u2019s opulence to excess.\u00a0Ruan Mei\u2019s buffs all play extremely well with other Harmony supports due to not affecting ATK at all and having two different buffs that fully stack with one another. Combine her with Asta or Hanya and you\u2019ll supercharge a damage dealer and make them a speed demon, or combine her with Tingyun and make a damage dealer\u2019s Ultimate frequent and absurd. You can even just use her alongside Bronya and have what is likely to be the new defacto strongest hypercarry setup in the game.Ruan Mei is also very good at facilitating double carry comps, overtaking Asta in that regard, as being able to buff everyone on the team with no effort means that it\u2019s quite easy to keep two damage dealers strong throughout a fight, especially with Ruan Mei\u2019s excellent SP economy. This means that in Kafka DoT teams and Topaz follow-up teams, Ruan Mei is poised to be the leading lass in terms of Harmony supports, and the improvement from including her will be extremely stark.Usually, I talk about support characters\u2019 damage contribution as \u2018non-negligible\u2019 meaning it\u2019s a nice addition to have. Just by being in the team and being well-invested, Breaking of smaller enemies will cause them to simply explode into confetti, again by simply being in the party. The defensive benefits of Breaking enemies quickly and keeping them Broken for longer also cannot be understated, and she can end up greatly assisting lower investment sustain options to keep up by uhh, lemme check my notes here\u2026 \u2018Murdering things before they can murder you.\u2019 Yeah that sounds about right.The one truly big downside of Ruan Mei is the obscene investment she demands to reach her peak. As stated earlier, reaching 180% Break Effect is extremely challenging, even with sacrificing your Link Rope. Even if you do reach that amount or close to it, you\u2019ll likely be sacrificing a fair few defensive substats as well, so this is something you need to account for, even if it is partially solved by the increase in Break frequency she provides. Outside of her signature, her Light Cone options are also fairly dismal all things considered, so this should also be taken into account.With how Ruan Mei and Xueyi\u2019s kits are designed, it seems to be pointing at a potential shift in what is considered strong or even possible; the focus on Break for both of these characters is somewhat suspect, and I\u2019d advise keeping a close eye on the progression of Ruan Mei over time. Even without that potential future, Ruan Mei is a powerhouse of a Harmony unit, and you can\u2019t go wrong by trying to obtain her.Also, stop it, you can\u2019t fix her. Stop it."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Sampo is a surprisingly powerful and consistent damage dealer specialising in Damage over Time (DoT). He has no issues hitting every single enemy on the field and rapidly applying and maintaining 5 stacks of Wind Shear with a high DMG multiplier. In addition to this, he also deals absurd amounts of Toughness Damage and can even be played fully SP positive if the situation calls for it. His Ultimate will also greatly increase the DoT that afflicted enemies will take, further improving his own damage as well as for any allies with DoT.Ah, Sam-po Kos-ki, was it? What an excellent character. Either you love him or you love to hate him, but whichever way you spin it, everyone loves Sampo, and for good reason! However, our good and definitely honourable friend has been flying under the radar for far too long, and I\u2019m here to remedy that. Prepare yourselves for some fully warranted shilling, baby.Sampo\u2019s Talent grants all of Sampo\u2019s attacks a 65% base chance to inflict Wind Shear for 3 turns. This Wind Shear can stack up to 5 times with each stack dealing up to 52% ATK at the start of each turn, for a total DMG multiplier of 260% at 5 stacks. I said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, that is an absurd amount of damage to be doing completely passively. For context, Kafka\u2019s Shock deals 290% and she\u2019s a fully fledged 5-star unit, and Sampo gets unreasonably close.The way this Wind Shear works is also extremely favourable to Sampo; you need only reapply the Wind Shear once to refresh the duration of the entire stack of Wind Shear, meaning you have 3 turns at base to keep your 5 stacked Wind Shear going, which is incredibly generous. Additionally, all of Sampo\u2019s attacks hit multiple times, meaning it is very easy to apply multiple stacks of Wind Shear with a single action, meaning the expected ramp-up time can also be a lot shorter than expected \u2014 his Basic ATK hits 3 times, his Skill hits 5-6 times, and his Ultimate hits 4 times against all foes.Sampo\u2019s Skill is a Bounce Ability, meaning it hits the primary target once guaranteed and then proceeds to Bounce its remaining hits across all enemies randomly. It hits 5 times in total with each hit dealing up to 56% ATK to the enemy it strikes. The initial Toughness damage is 30, with each subsequent hit being 15. This results in this Skill dealing a total of 280% ATK and 90 Toughness damage. Yes this is as absurd as it seems. Especially when going up against tougher Elites or Bosses, Sampo has no issues racking up the Toughness damage against them, and Wind-weak foes will be weeping in their Weakness Broken tears in no time.Sampo\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 160% ATK to all enemies on the field, hitting them 4 times each, and has a 100% base chance to apply a debuff that increases their DoT taken by up to 30% for 2 turns. This debuff applies to all DoT, including Sampo and his teammates\u2019, as well as any Break DoT on the enemy. This is an incredibly easy way to stack Wind Shear on many foes at once, and it has an average cost of 120 Energy. Since you\u2019re likely to be using Sampo\u2019s Skill often anyway, you can get this back very quickly.Sampo has some of the better Bonus Ability Traces among the early characters. A2 extends the duration of his Talent\u2019s Wind Shear by 1 turn, resulting in a new duration of 4 turns. 4 turns of Wind Shear. That means even the absolute fastest enemies in the game cannot escape the Wind Shear wrath, as they would need to take 4 entire turns before Sampo is able to even take one or use his Ultimate, which just isn\u2019t possible \u2014 nobody has a high enough skill issue to where this can ever happen, and if you say otherwise then you better be prepared with audiovisual proof bucko.A4 will refund an additional 10 Energy upon using his Ultimate, meaning the cost effectively goes down to 110, which is even more accessible and powerful. A6 I think is the one that people gloss over a lot because they don\u2019t read\u2026 Ehm, I guess this is a good time to say thank you if you\u2019re actually still reading this far, that must have been tough on you, proud of you.Anyway, Sampo\u2019s A6 makes it so that any enemies affected by Wind Shear will deal 15% less DMG to him. DMG reduction is an incredibly powerful and rare defensive stat \u2014 the Guard of Wuthering Snow Relic Set 2 piece effect is only 8% and that\u2019s already lowkey busted. Having a quite literally permanent 15% DMG reduction is absolutely invaluable because it raises Sampo\u2019s survivability by such an extent that he can actually get away with even more offensive substats. Even his Minor Traces reflect this, not having any DEF or HP Traces at all.Sampo is already strong without Eidolons, as a lot of his damage comes from the consistent nature of DoT without the need for CRIT stats. It\u2019s definitely not as flashy as seeing those big CRIT hits from other characters, but the sheer quantity of damage coupled with his Breaking ability makes for a fairly reliable teammate.However, he goes to another level with Eidolons. E1 will add an extra 6th Bounce to his Skill, increasing damage, Toughness damage and even Energy gain further. This is probably one of the most value E1s in the entire game, and is highly recommended for Sampo enjoyers. E2 will cause a defeated enemy with Wind Shear to have a 100% base chance to inflict all enemies on the field with 1 stack of Wind Shear, meaning Sampo can keep Wind Shear going quite easily even against respawning enemies.E4 is where the real juice is. When Sampo\u2019s Skill hits an enemy with 5 or more stacks of Wind Shear, the enemy immediately takes 8% of the current Wind Shear DMG. \u2018What? How is this the juice? A measly 8%?\u2019 Look closer, friend\u2026 It\u2019s 8% per hit. Sampo is able to detonate 48% of the current Wind Shear damage on enemies, and it even shows up as additional damage, meaning you\u2019ll see an absolute mess of damage numbers on enemies.\u00a0Finally at E6, he gets a permanent additional 15% DMG multiplier on his Talent\u2019s Wind Shear. Not DMG percent, DMG multiplier. So his Wind Shear goes from dealing, at this stage thanks to E5, 57.2% ATK to now dealing 72.2% ATK, for a new total of 361% ATK at 5 stacks of Wind Shear. Yeah.It\u2019s pretty clear that Sampo does an absurd amount of damage at virtually no cost now, and because of this it\u2019s very easy to build a team for him. Obviously pairing him with Kafka creates one of the strongest teams in the game thanks to Kafka being the DoT character, but by no means is Sampo shackled to only being a DoT teammate for Kafka.Sampo is fully capable on his own. Pair him with the standard hypercarry affair and watch the fireworks spark. Ruan Mei in particular is a great teammate for him due to her increased Weakness Break Efficiency, making Sampo\u2019s already oppressive Toughness damage even higher. SPD boosters like Hanya or Bronya can also greatly improve Sampo\u2019s overall damage, especially when he\u2019s at E4 or higher, and Tingyun can greatly improve his AoE consistency in modes like Pure Fiction.Sampo Koski is the archetypal jester character; he plays the fool for all to see because pretending to be weak amuses him\u2026 Sampo Koski is many things, friends, but weak is most assuredly not one of them. His facade is most impressive, but all it takes is a single look behind the curtain to ascertain the truth.Sampo Koski will see you for the next one!"

        "review": {
            "formatted": "The hot-headed swallowtail of the Underworld is an immaculate single-target damage dealer on the Path of the Hunt, strong enough to overcome the intrinsic weakness of Hunt characters and hit hard enough to where even resistant foes need to be on the lookout for her attacks. Enemy reinforcements need to be impressive to go toe to toe with Seele, because deadweights will only serve to fuel Seele\u2019s destructive power further.Seele\u2019s skill deals damage to a single target, and will simultaneously increase Seele\u2019s speed by 25% for 2 turns. Maintaining this speed boost indefinitely is extremely easy, and the speed boost is already very significant, meaning Seele is automatically one of the fastest acting characters in the game. The multiplier may initially seem low, but with the help of Seele\u2019s talent, her damage shoots skyward.Seele\u2019s ultimate immediately puts Seele into a Buffed state before dealing single-target damage. This Buffed state will have its effects active for the actual ultimate hit and will also persist for 1 turn after, meaning Seele\u2019s ultimate always has the Buffed values in-game.Her talent describes what her Buffed state does; she gains up to an 80% damage boost at max trace level whilst Buffed for 1 turn. Additionally, if Seele defeats an enemy, she will instantly gain an Extra Turn (not turn advance, a true extra action) and will become Buffed. She cannot trigger this extra turn again by scoring a defeat with the previous extra turn. Buffs do not tick down after Extra Turns, unlike Turn Advances.This is where Seele\u2019s crazy damage comes from. By simply playing her as you would any other SP spending damage dealer, you will end up benefiting greatly from the impressive dmg% boost the Buffed state gives you; using her ultimate will immediately trigger the Buffed state for Seele, and combining it with the passive procs from her talent after scoring defeats, Seele can end up spending the majority of combat affected by this Buff.Seele\u2019s Bonus Traces are mostly nice bonuses to have, with the exception of A4, which gives Seele a huge 20% Quantum RES PEN while she\u2019s in her Buffed state. Resistance penetration is a rare and powerful boost to damage, as it affects a separate multiplier in the damage formula, leading to much larger increases in damage. Because of the way this specific bonus works, it makes Seele even more effective against foes that are already weak to Quantum, equalises the field against neutral enemies, and even goes a long way to allowing Seele to put in damage against resistant foes! (Don\u2019t actually bring Seele if you know you\u2019ll be against super resistant foes, obviously.)What\u2019s more, Seele can manage to circumvent the inherent weakness in AoE scenarios that the exclusively single-target Hunt characters have thanks to her talent; if there are enemy reinforcements during a tough encounter, Seele can actually use them as a springboard to deal extra damage against her primary target, since spending a turn to defeat them will instantly grant Seele an extra turn with which to attack said primary target, only this time you\u2019ve got the exceptional damage increase and Qua RES PEN from the Buffed state.\u00a0She can virtually ping-pong across the battlefield, simultaneously dealing increased damage to the main foe whilst also indirectly dealing aoe damage, making her the only Hunt character who arguably gets stronger in aoe scenarios. The only caveat to this is that she becomes inordinately SP hungry, and maintaining this sort of pace can become incredibly challenging, unless of course you\u2019re killing off the trash adds with Seele\u2019s basic attack to conserve SP, in which case, that is a certifiable gigachad play.Something to consider when forming teams is the potential to encounter diminishing returns, due to how many damage buffs she already has, but usually if there\u2019s more than just another generic damage boost from the other supporting character, it will still contribute a lot to boosting Seele\u2019s already impressive damage (so yes, feel free to pair her with Bronya, it is the law, after all).All of this together makes Seele one of the hardest scaling units currently in the game. Being a Hunt character, she naturally has higher than average crit stats that are only boosted further by Light Cones, and her passive bonuses give her a huge leg up on many other units. She\u2019s a fantastic choice to go for, and for all those pulling for her, good luck!\u2026 She does need to chill out though."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Serval is a freely available 4-star Erudition unit thanks to the pre-registration milestones. She is a competent early damage dealer who remains decent throughout with sufficient investment. Serval revolves around applying Shock to enemies and dealing additional damage to all Shocked foes. Because of this, there is some ramp-up to her damage, but is generally reasonable to maintain after passing this initial stage. Despite having a DoT effect, she is more akin to a traditional damage dealer, preferring CRIT stats over raw ATK.The much-loved Belobog mechanic and hard rocker, Serval is an accessible Lightning damage dealer that will see a lot of use especially early on. It is highly advisable to invest in this character at least a little bit so that you\u2019re not left struggling against the many Lightning-weak foes the game throws your way in Belobog.Serval\u2019s main goal is to apply Shock to as many enemies as she can and keep the debuff going as long as possible, and this is because of her Talent\u2019s effects. When Serval attacks, she will deal an additional instance of Lightning DMG to all Shocked enemies, up to 72% ATK.Interestingly, this will proc even on enemies that you do not directly hit with your attack, so for example if you Basic ATK one enemy, but all five enemies are Shocked, this additional Lightning DMG will trigger on all five foes. Do pay attention to the term \u2018additional\u2019 because it is essentially adding a separate hit to Serval\u2019s attacks. This extra hit is also eligible for CRIT hits.Serval\u2019s Skill is a Blast AoE dealing up to 140% ATK to the main target and 60% to adjacent enemies. This Skill has an 80% base chance to Shock enemies hit for 2 turns, with the Shock dealing up to 104% ATK at the start of the enemies\u2019 turn. This is the only way for Serval to inflict Shock on enemies without Eidolons. Serval\u2019s Ultimate deals up to 180% ATK to all enemies on the field, and any enemies that already have the Shock debuff on them will have the debuff extended by 2 turns. This extension applies to all instances of Shock, not just her own personal one.Considering a significant portion of Serval\u2019s damage comes from her Talent, having an 80% base chance to apply Shock with her Skill is somewhat pathetic, actually. This is so low that you\u2019ll be missing the Shock application on the pitiful level 40 Automaton Beetles from the story, so you can imagine how frustrating it can be to try and land this Shock on endgame opponents. Additionally, because of her Skill\u2019s targeting method, Serval can struggle to apply Shock to more than 3 enemies at a time, and because of the aforementioned low base chance to Shock in the first place, this can compound into an incredibly unfavorable repeating instance of failing to apply and extend Shock.However, it is also possible to get the Shock applied quickly and then extending it is relatively simple; the very first Shock application of the fight is the hardest. As long as Serval is able to get frequent Ultimates, it will be challenging to drop Shock from that point on. Especially since Serval\u2019s Ultimate has a very low Energy cost of 100, this should be fairly achievable even with lower investment thanks to the wonders of the Passkey Light Cone or by pairing her with the likes of Tingyun or Huohuo.Serval\u2019s A2 is the most important of her Bonus Ability Traces as it increases the base chance for her Skill to inflict Shock by 20%, for a new total of 100% base chance. This now matches the typical base chance for most debuffs to be applied, and reduces the required Effect Hit Rate for a guaranteed application to be about 67%. A4 grants 15 Energy at the start of battle, and A6 grants a 20% ATK boost for 2 turns after defeating an enemy.Serval\u2019s design is honestly a little bit confusing. She\u2019s an Erudition unit who plays more like an odd mix of Nihility and Destruction, but unlike some of the other Path outliers like Qingque, Serval does not manage to run away with it. Honestly the Destruction-esque targeting of her Skill is not the biggest offender, it\u2019s her reliance on DoT whilst still being shackled to CRIT.The fact that her Talent has the ability to CRIT but requires enemies to be Shocked first is such a peculiar choice because it raises the floor on Serval\u2019s necessary stats to an entirely unreasonable level because you have to choose between a guaranteed Shock application or good CRIT stats. You would need god-tier level Relics to be able to get both and I\u2019d honestly rather have that luck for other far stronger characters who can do more with that level of crazy investment like Qingque or Xueyi.Usually, by this point, I\u2019d have already mentioned Eidolons but I\u2019ve left it for last for Serval because she may be the only character I would say is heavily reliant on Eidolons to perform up to par with other characters \u2014 most characters don\u2019t need Eidolons to be competitive, and there\u2019s a select few characters for whom Eidolons do not bump them into \u2018viability\u2019, but for Serval the difference between E0 and E6 is incomparable.E2 and E4 in particular completely change the way you go about executing Serval\u2019s gameplan; E2 grants 4 Energy each time her Talent deals damage, and E4 will allow her Ultimate to have a 100% base chance to apply the same Shock as her Skill to any enemies not yet Shocked. This immediately reduces the stat requirements to a far more reasonable level while also increasing Serval\u2019s overall damage output, and most importantly of all, reducing the possible causes of frustration when attempting to play her.Personally, I would not even try to use Serval at endgame without at least E4, but if you\u2019re prepared to suffer for your queen, you go right ahead. She\u2019s pretty decent either way and you\u2019re likely to have her at least somewhat invested due to her being a free character."

            "formatted": "Silver Wolf is a tremendously frightening support character who can circumvent enemy Weaknesses and dramatically debilitate her opponents. She is exclusively single-target focused, but she makes sure to completely dominate lone foes.Because of how Silver Wolf\u2019s abilities function, she essentially punishes enemies by simply existing within the same space as them. Her Talent has a moderately high base chance to inflict a Bug debuff onto any enemy that she attacks, up to 72% at max Trace level. These Bugs can reduce an enemy\u2019s ATK, DEF, and even their SPD, whilst not being mutually exclusive with each other; you can potentially have all three of these Bugs on a single enemy at the same time. Even more ridiculous perhaps, these last for a hilarious 3 turns, so maintaining these debuffs is hardly a challenge for our spry hacker.The Bug debuff strength is not particularly huge, but considering it costs nothing to apply, and can be applied by literally any of Silver Wolf\u2019s attacks, this is a very generous boost, especially once we talk about the rest of her kit.Silver Wolf\u2019s Skill deals modest damage and has a high base chance to add 1 Weakness of an on-field ally\u2019s Type to an enemy you target. This means the regular limitations of certain teams can be potentially ignored by including Silver Wolf in the party. Not only can you just point at an enemy and say \u2018You are now weak to [insert element here]\u2019, you also reduce their RES to that element by 20%, meaning it\u2019s truly as though they had that Weakness inherently.Clearly, this isn\u2019t strong enough already, so there is a separate chance to reduce the enemy\u2019s RES to all damage by up to a further 10% so that everyone in the party can benefit from the debuff. However, it\u2019s important to note that both the Weakness implant as well as the RES reductions only last for 2 turns by default, and the base chances to inflict them are modest at best, so Silver Wolf will need a healthy supply of SP to continue to refresh these powerful effects. You cannot have more than one implanted Weakness per foe, so don\u2019t try. You\u2019ll just overwrite your previous implant, or refresh it if there\u2019s only one choice.Already Silver Wolf is appearing to be a highly competitive and powerful support option, but here comes her Ultimate with the strength of a freight train to make sure we know for sure how good she is. Her Ultimate has up to a 100% base chance to decrease a target enemy\u2019s DEF by up to 45% for 3 turns. It also has a surprisingly generous multiplier on it too, dealing up to 380% of her ATK to said enemy on top.Considering each of these aspects of her kit separately already paints a beautiful picture, but realising that all of these effects can coexist simultaneously is nothing short of absurd. Silver Wolf is one the best supports for virtually any situation, especially for units with strong single-target damage and, even more than that, she creates the potential for mono-elemental teams.Since you can safely ignore the intrinsic weaknesses of an enemy if you get to just implant a new one, you can construct your \u2018perfect team\u2019 and take it pretty much wherever you damn well, please. Obviously, there are situations in which this is still less preferable than just making a different team that\u2019s more tailored to specific enemies, especially since Silver Wolf can get very SP-hungry very quickly, but the mere existence of such a possibility is what makes this character one of the strongest and likely longest-lasting units in this game.Silver Wolf can get even better thanks to her Bonus Traces. Her A2 extends her Bugs\u2019 duration by an extra turn, for a new total of 4 turns. It also lets Silver Wolf piggyback off of Weakness Break to potentially inflict a random Bug onto the enemy for free. This becomes quite relevant for her A6, where she will gain an extra 3% All-Type RES shred on her Skill if the enemy she attacks has at least 3 debuffs on them.The big one is her A4, which extends the duration of the Weakness implant from her Skill by an extra turn, for a new total of 3 turns. This very significantly reduces Silver Wolf\u2019s SP expenditure, and so this now extra SP can instead be used by the rest of her team.Because so much of Silver Wolf\u2019s kit revolves around applying debuffs, Effect Hit Rate is an incredibly valuable stat, and is likely a stat she wants to prioritize in order to consistently fill her support debuffer role. If you spend most of her turns throwing valuable SP at an enemy that keeps resisting everything, you\u2019re looking at an easy \u2018retreat and reset\u2019 scenario.Silver Wolf does get a few Minor Traces that improve her Effect Hit Rate for free, but this is not enough for the high-level foes you\u2019re likely to see in Memory of Chaos. Without her debuffs, Silver Wolf is not going to be contributing much damage of her own, but even if you only get to apply debuffs intermittently, their extremely generous durations mean you won\u2019t need to worry about reapplying them often.Silver Wolf has absolutely no need of her Eidolons, but if you really feel the need to go for more, Silver Wolf\u2019s Eidolons transform her into an obscene damage dealer, possibly one of the absolute best. This is not hyperbole\u2014with E6 it\u2019s quite likely she even beats out Seele in single-target, but really,\u00a0There is genuinely almost no scenario in which Silver Wolf isn\u2019t a fantastic option. Because she afflicts enemies with debuffs that reduce their resistances, she skyrockets teammates\u2019 damage beyond what other supports may be able to achieve by themselves.\u00a0She can elevate a team to reach damage numbers you\u2019ll likely never see without her, but you must not forget that Silver Wolf is exclusively single-target focused. There are times when Pela may be more beneficial for your team setup due to having an AoE DEF shred on her Ultimate that isn\u2019t notably weaker than Silver Wolf\u2019s Ultimate, or perhaps you\u2019d benefit more from turbo-buffing a single character who has AoE capabilities with Tingyun.\u00a0As good as Silver Wolf\u2019s debuffing is, the most important part is being able to build a team to make proper use of what she can offer; she\u2019s not going to be very useful if she\u2019s spending valuable SP to apply a Physical weakness when your only Physical unit is Natasha and you desperately need to apply an Ice weakness for your Yanqing, for example. Carefully choosing your teammates to maximize the likelihood of applying the correct weaknesses with her Skill is the key to success, because otherwise, she\u2019ll be hemorrhaging Skill Points for no discernable benefit.It is unlikely we will ever see a character with such remarkable capabilities again, and for that reason, it is highly likely that Silver Wolf will stay relevant for a very long time."

Choose the one with the more beneficial sub-stats. Link Rope - Energy Regen%Best in Slot for Sparkle.Additional notes for sub-stats:SPEED: When playing Sparkle you have two separate options when it comes to how much Speed to build on her:You can either build her as fast as possible often aiming to hit 160 Speed or higher (aka Hyperspeed Sparkle),or build her 1 Speed slower than your main damage dealer, often aiming for your main damage to be at 135 or 136 speed and Sparkle to be at 134 speed (aka -1 Sparkle). Learn more about both of the playstyles in the section below.CRIT DMG:Sparkle's skill scales with CRIT DMG and at max rank it grants her target 24% of her CRIT DMG plus an additional 45% meaning stacking as much CRIT DMG on her as possible is excellent. For every 4% CRIT DMG Sparkle has you can think of your carry as gaining 1%, it might not sound like much but it adds up fast! CRIT DMG is a secondary priority to getting your Speed stat just right but after that's achieved or maxed as high as is reasonable CRIT DMG is an essential second priority. "

            "formatted": "Messenger Traversing Hackerspace4P Hackerspace is the best supporting set for Hyperspeed Speed Sparkle. The 2P speed bonus is essential and the 4P set bonus boost applies to herself after she casts her Ultimate granting her more Speed to accelerate the target of her skill even more. At the highest levels of Speed or in Pure Fiction the small overall Speed boost this set provides can be the difference between an extra action or not for herself and her team in endgame. Using this set when utilizing Sparkle at -1 Speed can (when not managed perfectly) sometimes cause her to overtake her skill target messing up the syncing of the combo leading to large damage losses. When using this set and strategy exercise caution or avoid it. Eagle of Twilight LineIt's a great option for Hyperspeed Sparkle only, but farming it is not advised due to being very niche. Don't use on -1 Speed Sparkle.Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + RainbowSparkle's most practical set especially when pursuing high Speed and CRIT DMG values (160+ speed) is using a 2P set of Hackerspace and any other 2 pieces you have from any set with the maximum amount of Speed and CRIT DMG possible. Messenger Traversing Hackerspace + Guard of Wuthering Snow / Longevous DiscipleIf you have 2P Hackerspace covered with great sub-stats and main stats and have excellent pieces of either Wuthering or Longevous, the 2P bonus from these sets is welcome but not more valuable than more Speed or CRIT DMG sub-stats. Musketeer of Wild WheatAn alternative to using 2P Hackerspace in order to achieve the 6% Speed bonus but far more restrictive as the bonus is the 4P.

            "formatted": "Sparkle is the second limited Harmony 5-star. She has much of the power that Bronya provides while having none of the SP issues. Sparkle actually increases the SP cap of the team while she\u2019s on the team and has no trouble restoring the majority of those reserves with her Ultimate. Her Skill provides a massive CRIT DMG boost to a single character while Action Advancing them, and her Talent will provide a teamwide DMG boost whenever allies consume SP. She\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.It really seems like every new character really challenges what our perception of \u2018acceptable levels of crazy\u2019 is. In this instance, this applies both to the in-universe character as well as their playable counterpart. Sparkle takes your preconceived notions of \u2018buff cost\u2019 and tosses them straight out the window while laughing maniacally.Sparkle is a harmony buffer much like Bronya is, with many of the same sorts of benefits. I\u2019ll get this out of the way quickly so pay attention: no, Bronya is not \u2018dead\u2019; no, Sparkle is not a catch-all replacement for Bronya in all scenarios. Both characters have their benefits and drawbacks and some characters will always prefer one over the other. Both are good, both are great. Having said that, I think Sparkle is substantially easier to utilise to her fullest potential.\u00a0Sparkle\u2019s Talent starts this trend quite strong. When Sparkle is on the field, she increases the SP cap by 2, for a new total SP cap of 7. Whenever any ally consumes 1 SP all allies will have their DMG increased by up to 6% for 2 turns, and this can stack up to 3 times for a total DMG boost of 18%. With Sparkle, you can just have more SP than any other team would be able to have, and you also get what is essentially a permanent 18% DMG boost to all characters on your team.Sparkle\u2019s Ultimate will immediately recover 4 SP for the team, meaning the increased cap is put to good use. This will also grant the Cipher effect to all allies, increasing the per-stack DMG boost of her Talent by up to an additional 10% for 2 turns. This means she essentially grants a 48% DMG boost upon using her Ultimate; you don\u2019t have to reapply her Talent\u2019s effects through more Skill uses to reap the benefits, the extra 30% DMG boost gets added on the second you use her Ultimate, assuming you already had 3 stacks of her Talent.Instantly gaining back 4 SP is extraordinarily powerful as it pretty much outright fixes certain other DPS characters\u2019 rather lacking SP economy. Even if Sparkle herself only ends up very slightly SP positive, it is also important to factor in when this SP recovery occurs, as proper timing of this will result in someone like Imbibitor Lunae being able to sling out Fulgurant Leaps on his turn without any worry at all about disrupting the rest of the team\u2019s plans. Sparkle\u2019s Ultimate also has the same quirk that Huohuo\u2019s Ultimate has, in that using it at the start of a character\u2019s turn will not see the duration go down at the end of it, meaning you can effectively extend the Cipher duration to 3 turns with careful management, potentially even resulting in a permanently buffed DPS character if all else goes to plan.Now we\u2019re at the strong part. Sparkle\u2019s Skill will target a single ally and Action Advance them by 50%. In addition to this, she will also buff the ally\u2019s CRIT DMG by up to 24% of Sparkle\u2019s CRIT DMG, plus up to an additional flat 45% for 1 turn. The Action Advance is non-functional on Sparkle herself. This is a very similar ability to Bronya\u2019s Skill, but it differs in that it provides a CRIT DMG buff instead of a general DMG buff, and it\u2019s only half the Action Advance.\u2018Half the Action Advance? Doesn\u2019t that make it a lot worse, then?\u2019 Yes and no\u2026 Mostly no. The CRIT DMG makes it technically less universally applicable since DoT characters can\u2019t make use of it at all, but the 50% Action Advance actually belies a hidden strength, which is that it is substantially harder to fail to make use of a 50% Action Advance compared to a full Action Advance. Consider that you have up to 50% of the targeted character\u2019s Action Value in which to Advance them forward and lose no value from this Skill, but if you try and do the same with Bronya\u2019s Skill, technically you only ever get 100% effectiveness when they are buffed immediately after their last turn \u2014 and even then that\u2019s only true if Bronya is SPD tuned to be -1 SPD compared to them.In many of the different playstyles Bronya has to manage the team\u2019s SP reserves, it\u2019s quite likely that you will very rarely be fully utilising the extremely powerful 100% Action Advance her Skill provides. With Sparkle and her respective Skill providing \u2018only\u2019 a 50% Action Advance, you can be sure that you are getting the full value of that every single time you use it, and it can actually create a much easier time actually boosting a chosen DPS. This is even more noticeable with Sparkle\u2019s Ultimate providing a massive influx of Skill Points with which she can continue to use her Skill. Even though in terms of raw vacuum numbers Bronya can hold the edge, in practicality (and for the overwhelming majority of players that are not as tryhard as we are) Sparkle is going to have similar results for a lot less effort.Sparkle\u2019s Bonus Traces are interesting. A2 makes Sparkle\u2019s Basic ATK restore an additional 10 Energy, meaning she is the first ever character who restores 30 Energy with her completely basic Basic ATK. This allows for a lot more flexible rotations without interfering with Ultimate uptime, as the Energy she restores via her Skill and Basic now have parity. A4 is equally exciting, as it makes the CRIT DMG boost of her Skill last until the start of the target\u2019s next turn. This doesn\u2019t mean it lasts for a full 2 turns, but it does mean that this buff will catch out-of-turn actions such as Ultimates or follow-ups \u2014 extremely important for characters like Clara, Ratio, or Jing Yuan who deal a large majority of their damage outside of their own turns.A6 is probably going to garner a lot of attention. She increases all allies\u2019 ATK by 15% at all times, but if there are 1,2, or 3 Quantum characters in the team, she will additionally increase all Quantum characters\u2019 ATK by 5%, 15%, or 30% respectively for each QUA character. Some people may read this line and immediately think Sparkle is intended exclusively for Quantum DPS, but please, I implore you to re-read the literal entirety of the rest of her kit. She is a universal buffing support who just happens to have some small nice extras for Quantum centric teams. If your only use for her is in mono-Quantum, then more power to you, but you must always remember that you are squandering her potential by limiting yourself to just that.In terms of Eidolons, they\u2019re all nice bonuses to have but by no means a necessity. Every one of them looks very appealing at a glance, but you have to truly consider what that\u2019s worth to you \u2014 both in terms of increase over the base E0 character as well as monetarily in the real world. Sparkle is already competing for best support character at E0, so don\u2019t make any decisions you\u2019ll regret.Similar to Bronya, Sparkle also has a lot of possible builds and possible SPDs to operate at. It\u2019s easier to optimise compared to Bronya due to Sparkle\u2019s inherently higher SP economy and easier to utilise Skill buffs, so the one you choose to go for will depend entirely on teammates and preference. It\u2019s not something where I can tell you what to go for here. Regardless, there are really very few ways to play Sparkle incorrectly, and it\u2019s very possible to drag a no-SPD DPS character up to match Sparkle\u2019s SPD from her Skill alone. The ceiling for strong performance and especially upfront damage is going up quite considerably with Sparkle\u2019s release, and certain fan-favourite DPS characters are only going to get even better.Having said that, there most assuredly are ways to build Sparkle incorrectly, and she demands a certain level of investment and attention to detail to benefit maximally from her Skill\u2019s Action Advance; Bronya or Sparkle, the need for SPD tuning is utterly inescapable if you wish to use them to their fullest. Even if it\u2019s easier to utilise Sparkle\u2019s Skill compared to Bronya\u2019s, you still have to commit a base amount of investment to see worthwhile returns.Again, Bronya is not getting fully replaced or anything of the sort. Some characters will continue to prefer one over the other. Both are extraordinarily potent, and both will continue to be actively used in the top-performing teams until a new character comes out who supersedes them both. I mentioned this in Ruan Mei\u2019s review, and a very similar argument is present here; Sparkle may not be very far ahead of Bronya, if at all, when it comes to raw vacuum performance \u2014 Bronya\u2019s ceiling is just absurdly high even with her drawbacks. Having said that, in practicality, Sparkle will almost always have the edge due to her far more accessible skill floor, and thus will also usually have better performance compared to Bronya unless the piloting player is of an abnormally high skill level.Otherwise, get out there and rep the bestest most funnest Aeon, the Elation, and have yourself a grand old time. If I had a nickel for every time we got a completely unhinged Harmony support character, I\u2019d have two nickels. It\u2019s not a lot, but it is odd that it\u2019s happened twice. Needless to say, if you think you can \u2018fix\u2019 Sparkle, your arrogance knows no bounds, and godspeed. "

The damage boosts from the two alternative Cones are immense and can be kept up the majority of the time when playing Hyperspeed Sparkle (160+ build), but her signature still does edge them out slightly in overall damage boosts (but not by a massive degree). Sparkle's signature has advantages that those Cones do not have though. Its buff unlike the other two is almost always active where whereas the other Cones are only active on the turn you boosted the damage dealer meaning any action that occurs outside of the carry's turn is not affected such as Follow-up attacks and Ultimates. Which means that the signature wins by a landslide in those scenarios. As a general rule when playing the -1 Speed Sparkle that cannot maintain 100% uptime on her skill or when supporting characters that deal damage outside of their own turn like Clara, Dr. Ratio, or Jing Yuan, Sparkle's signature vastly outperforms alternatives but when supporting more static characters with the Hyperspeed Sparkle build like Imbibitor Lunae or Qingque her signature has less of an advantage."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Sushang is a competent single-target damage dealer with a focus on attacking Broken enemies and having Weakness Broken enemies on the field. She is able to fully Action Advance herself with her Ultimate and excels at putting on the pressure against Broken enemies. Both her damage potential and speed rely on having enemies in this state, so it is important to facilitate this with her teammates.Sushang feels like she\u2019s on the cusp of greatness, now more than ever with Ruan Mei\u2019s existence in the game. Being so focused around Breaking and abusing Weakness Broken foes, she only really needs a little bit more to come her way for her to become a highly dangerous boss killing machine.Sushang\u2019s Skill deals up to 210% ATK to a single enemy and has a 33% fixed chance to trigger Sword Stance on the final hit, dealing an additional 100% ATK. This bonus damage is guaranteed on Broken enemies. This is already a strong start with her Skill dealing potentially 310% ATK with nothing else. Sushang\u2019s Ultimate deals 320% ATK to a single enemy and immediately Advances her forward by 100%, meaning it is her turn now. She also gets a 30% ATK increase for 2 turns, and her Skill has 2 extra chances at triggering Sword Stance, with the extra procs being at 50% of the original damage.This means that Sushang\u2019s Ultimate boosts her Skill significantly. The extra ATK aside, having 2 extra procs of Sword Stance at 50% means she\u2019s essentially getting a full power bonus hit, meaning that if all 3 Sword Stances activate, Sushang\u2019s Skill is doing 410% ATK to a single enemy. Once again, keep in mind that against a Broken enemy Sword Stance is guaranteed to proc, including the bonus ones from her Ultimate. With the Ultimate having an average Energy cost of 120, this will be up fairly often. The addition of having a 100% Action Advance inherent to the Ultimate is also very powerful as you can make Sushang take back-to-back turns, maximising the damage you can deal against Broken foe.Sushang\u2019s Talent gives her a 20% SPD boost for 2 turns when an enemy on the field has their Weakness Broken. Sushang\u2019s base SPD is above average but a little on the lower end for Hunt units at 107, meaning her Talent will be granting her just about 21 SPD. This is still a pretty substantial increase to SPD and can possibly allow for her to run ATK Boots without worrying about SPD too much.Now, let\u2019s talk about the obvious issue with this kit; it has far too much reliance on having enemies be Broken. Pretty much all of what Sushang has to offer is contingent on that one big asterisk. Depending on what you\u2019re against, this may not be too much of a challenge, but even against simple Elites, the frequency at which you will be Breaking enemies will drop dramatically, especially if the Elite is not a summoner type. Boss enemies have even greater Toughness bars meaning it can take even longer to Break them.This may naturally incentivize the player to build for more Break Effect on Sushang, and the issue with that is that you kinda\u2026 can\u2019t, really. Let me elaborate by way of a comparison; Xueyi is a Break unit that directly benefits from building Break Effect thanks to a passive that grants an equivalent amount of DMG%, and even she can\u2019t afford to go all out on Break Effect because of diminishing returns and the desire for CRIT stats. Now imagine that but without the DMG conversion passive and exclusively single-target, and you\u2019ve got Sushang. Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s not ideal, especially since Xueyi also benefits from merely dealing Toughness Damage, while Sushang only gets her benefits upon an enemy getting fully Broken.Sushang is a very momentum-driven character; she thrives when enemies are Broken, and the goal is to make the most out of those situations before they recover. This is especially amplified by Sushang\u2019s A6 Bonus Ability Trace, which Action Advances her forward by 15% after using a Basic ATK or Skill if there\u2019s even a single Broken enemy on the field. This makes Sushang a deceptively speedy character, and both accentuates and exacerbates all of the aforementioned things in her kit. A2 also gives some nice DMG to Sword Stance every time it\u2019s triggered, and A4 exists.With Eidolons, Sushang becomes noticeably stronger. E1 will refund a Skill Point when using Skill against a Broken enemy, leading to never needing to worry about SP when attacking them. E2 will reduce Sushang\u2019s DMG taken by 20% after a Sword Stance is triggered for 1 turn, offering a nice and fairly significant reduction in damage taken. E4 grants Sushang a permanent plus 40% Break Effect which helps in dealing more damage when she is the one Breaking, and finally E6 allows the Talent\u2019s SPD boost to stack up to 2 times, also granting her one stack immediately upon entering combat. This means Sushang can gain almost 43 SPD from just her Talent alone, meaning she almost becomes a mini Seele in terms of raw Actions taken.Ah, but what\u2019s this? A comparison to Seele? Yeah don\u2019t get excited, when I say it\u2019s only in terms of raw Actions taken, I mean it explicitly. What Seele is is an anomaly when it comes to Hunt units because she actually gets better with more enemies around. Sushang, unfortunately, falls into the same category as \u2018every other Hunt unit besides Seele and maybe Ratio\u2019. Without sufficient help from supports or potentially even a second damage dealer, Sushang will absolutely hate going against multiple opponents. Add in the need for enemies to Broken and you now have a unit virtually glued at the hip to Ruan Mei, and even then it may still not be enough on its own if the enemy isn\u2019t also weak to Ice.The ramp-up to dealing damage can be excruciatingly long, and with how fast enemies become in the endgame, the window of opportunity to actually deal said damage is exceptionally short, so it\u2019s no surprise that units that simply don\u2019t have that limitation are typically far stronger than Sushang at much less effort \u2014 after all, who cares if the enemy is Broken if they\u2019re already dead? (This post made by Seele/Jingliu/JingYuan/Qingque/DHIL/Blade/Kafka\u2026 You get the idea.)Seriously, it gets almost annoying to have everything lined up perfectly with supports only to go in and hit numbers that make you rethink your life choices. On my way to call the police and report a goddamned robbery. Sushang may be fast but she doesn\u2019t have anything else in her kit to boost her damage like the ridiculous 80% DMG and 20% QUA RES PEN that Seele gets. The need for CRIT stats and ATK while also baiting people into building Break Effect can make for some of the most botched builds in the game; some of the worst builds I\u2019ve ever seen have all been on Sushang.Having said that, I return to what I said at the very beginning. With Ruan Mei existing now, break-focused builds and units have new life breathed into them. Now that we\u2019re at this juncture, my prediction is that we only need one more unit that can facilitate the Break playstyle for someone like Sushang to absolutely pop off. Mark my words, it\u2019ll happen.In any case, Sushang is still a competent character in her own right, and someone players are likely to have access to. Especially if you are lacking coverage for Physical enemies and don\u2019t have the likes of Argenti, Clara, or even Luka, then Sushang should be someone you consider building."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Tingyun is arguably the best 4-star support character in the game. She is able to boost a single ally\u2019s ATK and DMG significantly while also providing a large influx of Energy to said ally with her Ultimate. She is able to elevate damage dealers in hypercarry comps to impressive levels while remaining largely SP-positive. She is a staple support character and it is highly recommended that every player pursue her acquisition.This honestly might be the shortest review of the bunch because Tingyun is really rather cut and dry; she\u2019s just that good. If you don\u2019t have her, get her. If you have her and you\u2019re not using her, what are you doing??Tingyun\u2019s Skill selects a single ally to buff with Benediction, increasing their ATK by up to 50%. This ATK increase cannot be more than 25% of Tingyun\u2019s own ATK, so she does want some of that stat to better buff allies. Benediction is also unique in that it allows the buffed ally to deal additional Lightning DMG equal to 40% of the buffed ally\u2019s ATK. Benediction lasts for 3 turns.What this additional Lightning damage essentially does is provide a raw DMG multiplier increase to the buffed ally. I often say how rare certain damage boosts are, be it RES PEN or DEF Shred, but this one thing is actually the rarest. Raw increases to DMG multipliers is the single biggest increase to damage you can get because it\u2019s completely undiluted \u2014 in fact it makes any other boosts you get better. Tingyun being able to provide a boost of this calibre with a push of a button and have it last for 3 turns is immaculate. Not only this, but because it\u2019s tied to turn count rather than action count, anything that counts as an Extra Action will not deplete Benediction in any way, making things like Seele\u2019s Resurgence, ally follow-up attacks, or even just any Ultimates highly efficient.Tingyun\u2019s Ultimate restores 50 Energy for a target ally and increases their DMG by up to 50% for 2 turns. While it has a steeper than average Energy cost of 130, the ability to grant any ally you choose 50 flat Energy is exceptional. For many characters who rely on their Ultimates, Tingyun is an invaluable addition that allows them to have higher uptime on their big hitting setups. Even for characters who do not rely on their Ultimates, 50 Energy is 50 Energy; it\u2019s always appreciated.Tingyun\u2019s Talent also interacts with Benediction, causing an additional instance of DMG equal to 60% of the buffed ally\u2019s ATK whenever Tingyun uses her Basic ATK. This means Tingyun can also contribute some non-negligible damage in between reapplying her Skill\u2019s Benediction. It\u2019s not likely to be making a huge difference, but it can assist in defeating trash adds.Her Bonus Ability Traces are incredibly important to her gameplay. A2 increases her SPD by 20% for 1 turn after using her Skill, A4 increases Basic ATK DMG by 40%, and A6 will regenerate 5 Energy immediately at the start of each of her turns.Because of Tingyun\u2019s kit, the single most important stat to maximising her effectiveness is SPD. All the SPD in the world, because the faster Tingyun is, the faster she gets Energy back, and thus the faster she can give Energy back to your damage dealer. A 20% SPD boost for free after using Skill is very much appreciated, especially due to Tingyun\u2019s extraordinarily high base SPD of 112. Taking more turns before your damage dealers also means more opportunities to take advantage of the free Energy being given from A6. It is easily the most important stat for her.Eidolons are not a necessity for Tingyun, but there is a strong argument to be made for obtaining them at your convenience. They are all largely self-explanatory and as powerful as they say. E6 in particular is incredibly useful as it causes her Ultimate\u2019s Energy restore to go from 50 to 60. It may initially seem like a meagre increase, but you would be stunned at how big of a difference this makes in practice.For as long as damage dealers need Energy for their Ultimates, Tingyun will continue to be a dominant support character."

            "formatted": "Relic Main statsBody - CRIT DMG = CRIT RateBoth CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are viable options for Topaz's body armour. Which is better will depend on which gives you a better CRIT ratio - use the one that does.Feet - SPD = ATK%SPD or ATK can be best for Topaz depending on the team you're running with her and your build. Just running SPD boots on top of Topaz's base Speed of 110 allows her to hit the standard breakpoint of 134 meaning all other speed sub-stats and bonuses are wasted. If you are able to hit 134 without the use of Speed boots then you can run ATK% instead for a huge damage increase. The most common time this happens is when running Topaz with Asta as Asta grants an immense amount of Speed - so much that Topaz no longer needs any of her own to reach not only 134 speed but even 161 speed. If you can reach your desired breakpoint without SPD boots go with ATK if you want to play it safe or you can't use SPD boots.Planar Sphere - ATK% = FIRE DMG %ATK% and FIRE DMG% offer similar damage boosts for Topaz. In solo situations without many party buffs ATK% is slightly ahead but with heavy team buffs from Asta or Tingyun FIRE DMG% pulls slightly ahead. Use the one with the better sub-stats.Link Rope - ATK%ATK% Rope is the only viable option.Additional notes for sub-statsCRIT RATE & CRIT DMG: CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are Topaz\u2019s best damage scaling stats - shoot for the standard 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG. Topaz can afford to be a little below the usual CRIT RATE ratio thanks to her ultimate granting CRIT DMG - especially when using her signature as it also gives CRIT DMG not shown on the character sheetATK%: Topaz has no bonuses to ATK% in her kit so compared to other characters ATK% is comparatively far more valuable to her. Stacking it on SUB stats or Main stat pieces is a good damage increase and should not be neglected after getting a suitable CRIT ratio.DMG%: Generic and elemental DMG % isn\u2019t bad on Topaz but she already gets a massive amount of it for free from her Kit, the best relic sets: and Light Cones. A standard maxed-out Topaz fighting a fire-weak enemy with her signature gets 92% without using a FIRE DMG% Orb so getting more than this suffers from diminishing returns:22.4% Traces10% Fire Set Bonus15% Bonus Ability Vs Fire30% Signature15% SalsottoSpeed: Speed isn\u2019t bad on Topaz but most of her damage comes from Numby - and because Numby\u2019s speed is fixed and her allies have the ability to advance Numby\u2019s action it isn\u2019t as strong as it is on other characters. Speed still provides damage and quality of life though and thanks to her high base speed value it is a waste not to hit the standard breakpoints."

Still, if you're playing Topaz as an SP-neutral character, weaving her Basic into the rotation, this set will perform better.Firesmith of Lava-Forging + The Ashblazing Grand DukeIf you're still farming the new Ashblazing set, you can combine it with Firesmith and it will still yield better results than the old combinations.Firesmith of Lava-Forging + Musketeer of Wild WheatThe best 'old meta' pick for Topaz, but sadly with the release of Ashblazing it's getting outperformed badly.Musketeer of Wild WheatThe 4-piece Musket is a good, accessible, alternative compared to the mix-and-match set which is difficult to acquire. The Atk% is perfect for Topaz but the SPD is not always needed and sometimes goes on to be wasted unless pursuing a Speed breakpoint higher than 134 Speed which will affect this sets performance overall.Firesmith of Lava-ForgingSuffers from the same problems as the 4-piece Musket but offers less damage potential and is harder to farm making it a small downgrade overall.Inert SalsottoBy far Topaz's best planar set thanks to the CRIT RATE and generic damage boosts to her entire Kit's damage from the follow-up attack multiplier.Firmament Frontline: GlamothWorks great on Topaz if you can reach the Speed breakpoints.Space Sealing StationFalls slightly behind Inert Salsotto for Topaz and makes achieving a good CRIT ratio a lot more difficult. As your gear improves and you run Topaz with supports this set also falls even further behind because of diminishing returns. Still her 2nd best option for now though."

The only thing holding Clara back from being completely broken with Topaz is the requirement that she needs to be hit in order to trigger her follow-up attacks.

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Topaz is a unique hybrid of a secondary damage dealer and dedicated support for units with follow-up attacks (emphasis on support). She is capable of significantly increasing the follow-up damage a single enemy can receive indefinitely, with the increase to damage being a separate multiplier in most instances, resulting in an even larger increase. She also contributes fairly decent direct and Toughness damage of her own, and can use SP with a high degree of flexibility, even being able to be fully SP positive. Her biggest downside is that she is exclusively single-target focused and can struggle in even 2 target scenarios. Her personal damage output also relies on enemies getting hit by follow-ups, limiting her usefulness as a secondary damage dealer for non follow-up centric units.As a tax collector for the IPC, Topaz doesn\u2019t exactly make the best first impression, after all, tax evasion is an obligation (for legal reasons this is a joke). As a playable unit, Topaz is also somewhat intriguing. She is our first dedicated support character for the follow-up mechanic, meaning by design she is already slotting herself into a very specific type of gameplay and with very specific teammates.I will mention immediately that Topaz is not a particularly flashy character, nor is she really a character that is able to work out of the box as well as other hypercarries - at least as of the initial time of writing this. She is primarily a support character. Outside of her great single-target damage, she also doesn\u2019t tend to contribute as much as other units do for double or triple carry setups that don't rely on follow-up attacks - she really is tailor-made for teams with dedicated characters that can abuse her debuff. Within those follow-up teams, Topaz can elevate both her own and her teammates' damage output quite considerably, and is likely to become a mainstay for units like Jing Yuan, Clara, and maybe even Himeko too. Just know immediately that outside of those specific setups, you should not expect Topaz to be replacing any units you are likely already utilizing in other teams.With that out of the way, let\u2019s discuss what makes Topaz good in her specific teams. Topaz\u2019s Skill is the most important tool in her kit. It will deal follow-up damage up to 150% of Topaz\u2019s ATK to a single enemy target, and additionally inflict them with a debuff called Proof of Debt, which increases the damage they take from follow-up attacks by up to 50% at max Trace level. This 50% is in most cases a separate multiplier, meaning it takes effect after everything else has been calculated and will result in a significantly higher increase to damage than you may expect. Damage amps like this are incredibly rare and are extremely potent. The Proof of Debt debuff itself lasts indefinitely until either the target enemy is defeated or Topaz uses this Skill on another foe. If no enemy has Proof of Debt when an ally\u2019s turn begins or when they act, Proof of Debt will be randomly applied to one of the remaining enemies.Her Talent is her pet Trotter, Numby. Numby is very similar to Jing Yuan\u2019s Lightning-Lord in that it is a summoned entity with its own SPD value and turn order, and will disappear if the summoner is downed in combat. On Numby\u2019s turn, it will deal damage up to 150% of Topaz\u2019s ATK to a single enemy that has been afflicted with Proof of Debt. Numby\u2019s SPD is 80 by default, making it fairly slow to act, but whenever enemies afflicted with Proof of Debt receive an ally\u2019s follow-up attack, Numby will have its action Advanced Forward by 50%, resulting in it getting to act far more frequently than you may initially be led to believe. Note, this Advance Forward cannot be triggered on Numby\u2019s own turn, so this effect relies on your team being able to use follow-ups.Topaz\u2019s Ultimate buffs Numby for 2 turns. Numby enters the Windfall Bonanza! State, exclamation mark included, and its damage multiplier increases by up to 150%. It also benefits from an additional 25% CRIT DMG. Similar to Clara\u2019s Ultimate, Topaz\u2019s Ultimate temporarily lessens the restrictions on her Talent\u2019s Advance Forward activation; while Windfall Bonanza! is active, when enemies with Proof of Debt are hit by ally Basic ATKs, Skills, or Ultimates, Numby will have its action Advanced Forward by 50% as well. This means it\u2019s very easy to have Numby acting nearly back to back during its Enhanced state, as you temporarily do not need to rely on exclusively follow-up attacks to trigger the Advance Forward.Her Bonus Ability Traces improve her performance quite considerably. Her A2 Bonus Ability will transform her Basic ATK into a follow-up attack, meaning it will now also benefit from Proof of Debt\u2019s damage amp, as well as accelerating Numby\u2019s next attack with the Advance Forward. Her A4 will grant her and Numby 15% increased DMG against all enemies with a Fire Weakness, and her A6 will regenerate an additional 10 Energy for herself when Numby attacks under Windfall Bonanza!, effectively reducing the amount of Energy she needs to use her Ultimate again.Eidolons are not necessary for Topaz, and while they\u2019re not really that bad at all, they\u2019re also not really worth chasing extra copies of Topaz to get. E1 is good value if you\u2019re really adamant about going for Eidolons, as it can increase the CRIT DMG of follow-ups against Proof of Debt debuffed enemies by 25%, stacking up to 2 times.The gameplay plan becomes fairly simple: afflict the primary enemy target, usually a Boss or Elite, with the Proof of Debt debuff, and then pelt them with as many follow-up attacks as possible to get Numby to sic \u2018em as often as possible. Rather surprisingly, this is in fact as easy as it sounds as far as Topaz herself is concerned. Her Skill counts as a follow-up attack, and with her first Bonus Ability, her Basic ATK also functions as a follow-up attack, so every time Topaz acts, it\u2019s going to be Advancing Forward Numby\u2019s turn.This Advance Forward mechanic is the reason why Topaz benefits greatly from allies with follow-up attacks in their kit as well, as it can even further increase the number of times Numby will attack, creating a sort of feedback loop wherein Topaz buffs the ally follow-up attacks and gets increased personal damage output in the process. Even with the more infrequent follow-ups like from Jing Yuan\u2019s Lightning-Lord, the difference in Topaz\u2019s personal damage output is quite noticeable.She can use SP however you need once an enemy is afflicted with Proof of Debt; using Skill will consume 1 SP but will give greater damage, Energy gain, and Toughness damage, but using Basic ATK will deal only slightly less of each while recovering 1 SP instead. Since both count as follow-up attacks, Numby is always benefitting. Numby itself is also doing good Toughness damage every time it attacks, meaning together with Topaz, the amount of Toughness damage being dealt to a single foe is actually really quite high. It is not uncommon to be breaking extremely frequently with Topaz in the party as long as the enemy is Fire weak.As mentioned early on, Topaz is exclusively single-target focused, as is tradition for Hunt characters. With the climate of the game being extremely focused on Blast and AoE scenarios, this is quite a heavy limitation to be faced with, and is somewhat circumvented by pairing her with her intended follow-up heavy teammates, as their follow-ups are all AoE. This way, Topaz can safely mark the main Elite or Boss and have the ally follow-up attacks clear the field of trash adds. Attempting to utilise Topaz as a secondary damage source in teams without follow-ups, or as a solo hypercarry, will result in subpar performance compared to other damage dealers who can attack more than one target at the same time.Topaz is meant for follow-up teams, buffing other characters who also have follow-up attacks. By herself, Topaz is not comparable to most other dedicated damage dealers, to say nothing of the likes of Imbibitor Lunae or Jingliu. She does not have the types of intrinsic stat boosts or damage amps that many of those sorts of characters have, and so becomes incredibly reliant on having definitively good gear and Relics. Since many of her teams involve 2 damage dealers and a sustain option, it limits her access to buffs making good gear even more important, potentially even raising the quality requirement from good to great.Do not make the mistake of seeing the Hunt symbol and thinking she is comparable to the likes of Seele. Topaz is a support first, damage dealer second. If you do not already have the follow-up characters that work well with her, you should not reasonably expect her to perform to her best. If you are banking on getting Clara, or to a lesser extent Himeko, from the Regular Warp or its 300 pull guarantee, or are waiting for a Jing Yuan rerun to occur to guarantee him, then Topaz is a very solid investment, as those teams will likely have Topaz remain as a staple choice indefinitely from this point on. If you already have these characters, then you\u2019re set to benefit greatly from Topaz.If none of that applies to you, then really you should be asking yourself for what reason you\u2019re pulling for Topaz. If it\u2019s just because you like her character, design, or aesthetic, then hey, I get it, you do you. But if your reasoning is because of some hypothetical future characters that might benefit from what Topaz offers, then that may not be a compelling enough reason, especially if that decision involves a conversation about real-life spending. As the Trailblazer themselves say, \u2018When there is the chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won\u2019t regret\u2019.For the rest of us who have teams ready for her, Topaz herself is likely to continue to improve over time, especially seeing as she has a very rare and powerful debuff, but as was said with Kafka, the character\u2019s strength must be evaluated based on what they can do now. If something changes and Topaz gets verifiably better, you can trust me to keep this review updated.Oh and she powercreeps Simulated Universe. Small chance to obtain a whole damn Curio after defeating enemies with her Technique active? Sheeesh."

            "formatted": "The Preservation version of the Trailblazer deals decent damage for a defensive unit and quite significant Toughness damage as well. They also offer small but consistent party-wide shields at no additional cost. They are able to circumvent enemy lock-ons and unfavourable targeting through their Skill, taunting enemies and provoking them into attacking only the Trailblazer. Later on, they are able to provide teamwide damage reduction that can significantly reduce damage from hard hitting enemy and Boss AoE attacks.Following the very epic events on Jarilo-VI, the players gain access to the Preservation flavour of the Trailblazer. This is a unit that attempts to consolidate defensive utility with damage and Toughness damage. Compared to the Destruction variant, this ends up being significantly more successful, and is a version of the Trailblazer that still sees quite widespread use even now when far more (and far more powerful) sustain characters exist.The big draw of the Preservation Trailblazer is their Talent. After using any action, be it a Basic ATK, Skill, or Ultimate, the Trailblazer will apply a shield to all allies for up to 6% of their DEF plus 80, lasting for 2 turns. This is not a large shield by any stretch of the imagination, even at unreasonable DEF values, but the cool part is that it is reapplied by any action, meaning these shields are quite good at dealing with small but frequent sources of damage; even though these shields are unlikely to fully mitigate any attack in the late game, the damage that does end spilling over will be significantly reduced.The Trailblazer also gains stacks of Magma Will whenever they are hit or use their Basic ATK or Skill, stacking up to 8 times. At 4 stacks, their Basic ATK will be Enhanced, becoming a Blast AoE that deals damage to adjacent foes as well. This Enhanced Basic also deals increased Toughness damage to the main target. This attack consumes the 4 stacks of Magma Will and will not add any back.The Trailblazer\u2019s Ultimate deals damage to all enemies on the field, dealing up to 100% ATK plus 150% of the Trailblazer\u2019s DEF. This also automatically Enhances the next Basic ATK at no cost. The upfront damage is certainly nice, but the more impactful aspect of this Ultimate is that it deals 60 Toughness damage to all enemies on the field and also counts towards activating the Talent, meaning it is possible to activate this during the enemy\u2019s turn to refresh the shields in a pinch.Their Skill assumes a defensive stance, reducing incoming damage by up to 50% and having a 100% base chance to Taunt all enemies for 1 turn. This provoke is how the Trailblazer can circumvent lock-ons and redirect strong damage, so that in the inevitable situation where your Foxian teammates end up taking The World\u2019s damage, you have an opportunity to prevent that from resulting in their death. The base chance is high, but on its own is insufficient to provide a true 100% chance of provoking enemies, especially at higher levels and in later stages of Memory of Chaos.It is not (always) fatal if you do not land the Taunt, as their A2 Bonus Ability Trace provides a 15% damage reduction for the rest of the team for 1 turn whenever the Trailblazer uses their Skill, meaning even if the enemy cannot be made to attack them specifically, the damage reduction on top of the Talent\u2019s shields will do a great job at protecting the other party members. Their A4 restores 5% Max HP whenever they use an Enhanced Basic, and then A6 provides a very tangible 5 Energy per turn so long as the Trailblazer remains shielded. It also provides a very not-tangible 15% ATK increase.As is the case with the Trailblazer being the main character, you are going to gain access to all of their Eidolons over time by just playing. Unlike the Destruction variant, these Eidolons are actually quite compelling. E1 makes their Basic ATK and Enhanced Basic have additional DEF% scaling, 25% and 50% respectively. This is ultimately pretty negligible unless you\u2019re building for more of a bruiser type of Preservation Trailblazer, in which case it can actually be a pretty significant increase to their overall damage contribution.E4 grants 4 stacks of Magma Will at the start of a fight, but E2 and E6 are the big big ones. E2 increases the value of the Talent\u2019s shields by an extra 2% DEF plus 27, for a new total value of 8% plus 107. While still rather paltry shields compared to the ones that someone like Gepard can provide, you should remember that these are entirely free shields that are refreshed upon every action of the Trailblazer. E6 will increase the Trailblazer\u2019s DEF by 10% for every Enhanced Basic ATK or Ultimate they use, up to 30%, providing yet further bonuses to their kit.In the early and mid game, the shields provided by the Preservation Trailblazer are more than enough on their own to completely stifle enemy damage, as the base values are quite high at that point. Later on, however, this starts to be less and less true, as enemy damage starts to climb extraordinarily quickly, enough that if your focus is shielding, you better be damn sure that those shields can endure at least a few attacks before getting broken. Even with the quick reapplication, even singular attacks from non-Elite enemies can easily do in the thousands of damage, far more than the Trailblazer will ever be able to mitigate within reason; for context, you\u2019d need to hit 5-digit DEF values for the shields to be able to exceed 1000, and that\u2019s not happening, even inside the Simulated Universe.As such, the Preservation Trailblazer is not able to remain the solo sustain unit of a team unless the player is exceptionally brave. Even then, it remains inadvisable in most cases. There are a few enemies who get completely shafted by a Taunt, like Voidranger Tramplers or Malefic Apes, and in cases where they are the main threats of an encounter, Preservation Trailblazer can actually be a suitable stand-in for a proper sustain unit. Do note that in these cases, they are very SP negative, as their Taunt requires they spend Skill Points, so keep this in mind when building a team around their Taunt.Because of the shielding that is generally inadequate on its own in the late game alongside the quite meaningful Toughness damage that the Trailblazer can dish out, they become a competent unit in a double defensive setup, one where you have two units who are typically considered sustains. Their passive shielding complements another sustain character\u2019s healing very well, making it truly very difficult for allies to die when there are two layers of protection. The Toughness damage also helps to alleviate the otherwise colossal damage loss you incur by replacing either another support character or a damage dealer with the Preservation Trailblazer, though this is contingent on the enemy being weak to Fire.Double defensive comps are almost always suboptimal, but in the event your dedicated sustain unit is incapable of keeping the team alive, the Preservation Trailblazer can readily turn that \u2018maybe\u2019 into a \u2018definitely\u2019 \u2014 and, hey, if your damage dealers already have no issues decimating anything that\u2019s put in front of them, then why not enjoy the extra comfort that Preservation Trailblazer can offer?It is an ultimately inescapable fate that the Preservation Trailblazer will see less and less use over time, both for you specifically, and for the general playerbase. Players nowadays have access to stronger, more versatile, and more interesting characters, and team slots are invariably limited to a maximum of four. The days of shoddy sustain units are largely behind us, and with them goes one of the most compelling reasons to use Preservation Trailblazer. Even still, despite all of this the Preservation Trailblazer is still seeing use, and will likely continue to do so until the day all players can get amazing sustain characters entirely for free.\u00a0Nowadays especially, Preservation Trailblazer has slotted themselves into the position of a dedicated Breaker due to their aforementioned high Toughness damage. Since there\u2019s no pressure to use their Ultimate for raw damage and it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019re your only sustain unit, it is relatively easy to guarantee that they will be the one Breaking opponents, giving a great way to make up for the damage you\u2019d otherwise be losing by not using a different unit. The role consolidation is very much appreciated, and with Pure Fiction now in the game, the Preservation Trailblazer has another compelling use case.As with the Destruction Trailblazer, investing a lot into Preservation Trailblazer will definitely see their usefulness and power increase, but there are many characters and there will be many more, and resources are finite, even including new forms of the Trailblazer themselves. Putting your resources into the Preservation Trailblazer definitely won\u2019t be wasted, but just keep in mind what the Trailblazer says: \u2018When you make a choice, make one you know you won\u2019t regret.\u2019\u2026 The Ultimate animation will always be top tier, though."

If you can't obtain an HP% body armor with good sub-stats or have an excellent DEF% body armor with good sub-stats use that instead. Feet - SpeedBest in Slot.Planar Sphere - HP% > DEF%Aim for HP% on Sphere to help remedy Harmony' Trailblazer's initial low defensive stats. If you can't obtain an HP% Sphere with good sub-stats or have an excellent DEF% Sphere with good sub-stats use that instead. Link Rope - Break Effect >= Energy Regen Break Effect is the most optimal choice as long as you can maintain 100% ultimate uptime without an Energy Recharge Rope. Whether this is possible will depend on the Eidolon level and the Cone of your Trailblazer primarily, but can also depend on how many hits you take and how many talent activations you are able to trigger in battle. If you don't have E6 or S5 Meshing Cogs/Memories of the Past, an Energy Rope may be required. Additional notes for sub-statsSPEED: Speed is one of only two scaling stats the Harmony Trailblazer has to improve their kit output as such stacking as much of it as possible is imperative with the key breakpoints being 134 first and foremost for endgame content and 145 if you are using Talia. Even after these breakpoints, Speed continues to be useful offering more frequent actions contributing to faster Breaks and more frequent Super Breaks, increasing damage output. Speed is a must-have offensive stat that allows Trailblazer to unlock their Super Break earlier but when using Trailblazer's skill every action with high speeds ensure you manage your skill points appropriately so you don't run out. Break Effect%: Break Effect% is Trailblazer's other core stat increasing not only their own personal damage through Super Break but also their supportive effects after unlocking E4 thanks to granting 15% of their total Break Effect to allies. Gaining as much Break Effect as possible is absolutely a top priority and with nothing else to spend your sub-stats on other than Speed and Defenses there's no excuse not to go all out. Energy Recharge%: Harmony Trailblazer's ultimate is almost their entire kit and without it active they aren't able to do their job. Fortunately, by stacking the right amount of Energy Recharge, it's trivial to keep the Ultimate active permanently through a combination of gameplay, gear, Cones and Eidolons. Exactly how easy 100% ultimate uptime is and how skill point restrictive the end result will be, depends on your Trailblazer's investment level. Trailblazer has multiple Eidolons and a talent that grants an abundance of Energy at different points of battle.Unfortunately the best of which - their E6 -  is not available on initial release meaning your Energy investment will need to be higher until it can be obtained. At E4 it's recommended you use either S5 Meshing Cogs/S5 Memories of the past + Break Rope OR an Energy Rope + any other Light Cone with the first option being the more favorable one and spamming your skill to ensure 100% ultimate uptime. Gaining access to more Energy Recharge than these two setups can allow Harmony Trailblazer to use basics in their rotation, lowering damage but easing skill point costs (this can be achieved pre-E6 with S5 memories/cogs and an energy rope but at the cost of break). After E6 releases, you'll be free to use any Cone with a break rope equipped or make use of even higher energy recharge builds capable of getting even faster and more frequent ultimates for specialized builds.

        "review": {
            "formatted": "The Harmony Trailblazer is the first of their kind, being a fully dedicated Break support. They provide teamwide Break Effect and unique benefits for attacking Broken enemies in the form of Super Break DMG, dealing considerable Break DMG based on the character's Break Effect and the Toughness-reducing damage of the attack. The Trailblazer themselves deal extremely high Toughness damage, meaning they will also be able to contribute very high damage against Broken targets. This Super Break counteracts the natural downside of Break setups; the damage usually trails once an enemy is Broken, but with the Harmony Trailblazer, it only increases that damage \u2014 vastly so.You know, it seems like as more and more Harmony characters get released, Xipe must have a clause in the Harmony contract that states 'Thou shalt be damn strong and have mad swag' because every single one of them has been outstanding, and the Harmony edition of the Trailblazer is no different. If you were worried that the Trailblazer's new behatted form isn't worthy of hanging with the greats and is doomed to never be used, then I have some great news for you because it looks like the Harmony Trailblazer is going to become a staple support for Break focused teams moving forward.Their Skill is a Bounce ability, dealing up to 50% ATK damage to a target enemy and then dealing an additional 4 hits of the same damage to random enemies after. As a Bounce ability, this has a tremendous amount of Toughness damage attached to it, especially if you're against small numbers of enemies. Especially since the Harmony Trailblazer wants to Break enemies as quickly as possible to take advantage of their Ultimate's effects, if the enemy is weak to Imaginary you'll be absolutely bullying them with this Skill.This Skill helps a lot with Energy gain as well, so it's highly recommended to use this every single turn to maximize the gains from both aspects. Their Talent also plays into this by providing up to 10 Energy whenever an enemy target's Weakness gets Broken, so Breaking faster also regenerates Energy faster. This is triggered on any Break, so you don't necessarily have to have the Trailblazer being the one to Break enemies to benefit from this.Now for the Ultimate, it's the most important aspect of their kit. For the cost of 140 Energy, they grant all allies, including themselves, a buff called Backup Dancer that lasts for 3 of the Trailblazer's turns. Allies with Backup Dancer will have their Break Effect increased by up to 30% and gain access to a new exclusive mechanic called Super Break. When an ally with Backup Dancer hits a Broken enemy, they will deal an instance of Super Break DMG, and this damage is based on both the Break Effect of the attacking character as well as the Toughness DMG of this attack.This new Super Break mechanic is the answer to the most profound question that has plagued full Break setups up to now, which is 'I've broken the enemy! Now what?' \u2014 when you Broke an enemy before, you got a huge influx of damage upon the initial Break, but all that Break Effect you stacked is useless until the target recovers from Break. It was the ironic downside of Ruan Mei's Weakness Break Efficiency for Break users, in that delaying the enemy from recovering from Break was actually worse for you. But now with Harmony Trailblazer's Super Break, all that Break Effect comes in like Truck-kun to decimate the already Broken enemy, turning the ironic disadvantage of a Broken enemy into the time where the team can put out their most potent damage.Now is probably the time to explain why Break DMG is so special and unique. Break DMG is not like other sources of damage in this game in that it has far fewer ways to be affected; unsurprisingly CRIT stats do nothing, but even things like your usual DMG% increases will also do nothing. No other stats besides Break Effect will affect the Break DMG, but certain character effects and debuffs on enemies will also be able to increase the Break DMG enemies receive; things like Gallagher's Talent increasing Break DMG directly, or reducing enemies' DEF or Elemental RES, or applying vulnerability. This also goes both ways, so if an enemy has increased stats, they will end up taking less damage.Break DMG also gets increased based off of the enemies' Maximum Toughness, so you'll do much more Break DMG against a Boss or Elite with a large Toughness bar than you would against an elemental bird that gets Broken in a single hit. This is actually not the case for Super Break, meaning you can do the same amount of extra damage against all enemies once they're Broken, though the initial Break DMG will still be affected by the enemy Max Toughness as normal.It's particularly interesting that Super Break also cares about the Toughness damage of the action that triggers it, so other support characters can end up dealing a surprising amount of damage with Super Break; once again, Gallagher is a particularly great example of this due to his Ultimate and Enhanced Basic combo being a huge total of 150 Toughness, and Aventurine is also a great example thanks to his frequent Bouncing follow-up from his Talent. The Harmony Trailblazer themselves will be consistently making full use of these effects thanks to their high Toughness damage Skill as well as obviously being incentivised to build for maximum Break Effect, so don't be surprised to be easily broaching 6-digit damage numbers with the dapper hatter.The Bonus Ability Traces matter quite a bit, not just because they're really good but because Break DMG cares immensely about your Character Level. Their A2 will increase the damage of Super Break based on the number of enemies on the field, having higher benefits the fewer enemies there are; you get a 20% increase against 5 or more enemies, but you get a whopping 60% increase against only a single target. Either way, you're getting a substantial boost because this increase to Super Break is actually a separate final multiplier, making this an inordinately powerful damage increase.A4 will similarly provide a massive boost, increasing the Toughness damage of the initial hit of their Skill by 100%. This is ambiguous so let me elaborate. As a Bounce ability, the initial hit has the most Toughness damage, followed by a halved value for all remaining hits. This generally puts 5-hit Bounce abilities in the range of about 90 Toughness damage, about the same as most single-target Ultimates. By doubling the value of the initial hit, the Harmony Trailblazer's Skill now deals a colossal 120 Toughness damage, putting it on par with Xueyi's Ultimate and Imbibitor Lunae's Fulgurant Leap.A6 also provides a massive benefit that was previously a downside for Break setups. Whenever an ally Breaks an enemy, their next action will be delayed by 30%. This allows for more time to wrack up the impressive damage from Super Break and also doubles as a means of improving team survivability. This delaying effect stacks extremely well with both Ruan Mei's Ultimate and Welt's Ultimate; you can actually send enemies to the shadow realm and then keep them there for long enough to get obliterated by the subsequent Super Break damage.Since this is the Trailblazer, we will eventually get access to all of their Eidolons, though it may not be immediate. E1 will refund a Skill Point for the first Skill of a fight, making it easier to get the ball rolling without screwing over your DPS, and E2 will grant 25% Energy Regeneration Rate for 3 turns at the start of combat, speeding up the rate at which you get the first Ultimate. E4 will increase the Break Effect of all other allies by 15% of the Trailblazer's current Break Effect, and this will dynamically update if the Trailblazer's Break Effect changes. E3 and E5 are both very appreciated Trace levels. Finally, E6 will add 2 extra hits to the Bounce of the Skill, for a new total of 7 hits, resulting in this one Skill dealing a hilarious 150 Toughness damage, tied with Argenti's Lv2 Ultimate for the most Toughness damage on any single ability. The extra hits also mean this Skill will regenerate more Energy, opening up some more build flexibility in terms of Light Cones.With this particular kit, it's no surprise that Ruan Mei is an exceptionally good pairing with Harmony Trailblazer; one helps you Break faster and the other helps you delete the then-Broken foe. Ruan Mei\u2019s Weakness Break Efficiency also helps to improve the damage from Super Break. While this is the ideal combination, you should not despair if you do not have Ruan Mei, as Harmony Trailblazer is more than powerful enough to be the complete backbone of Break teams moving forward. Other units can also be substituted to achieve whichever result is most desirable. If you want more actions then Bronya or Asta can grant the Break DPS more effective SPD, and if you want to make sure the enemy never gets up again you can use Silver Wolf or Pela to send the enemy's DEF to Caelid.Once again, I'm mentioning Gallagher, because this man just keeps on winning. As already mentioned, his Talent directly improves team Break DMG, his own Toughness damage is highly impressive, and he has no troubles keeping the team alive, especially at higher Eidolon levels. You are also incentivized to build him with Break Effect in mind, so he can provide very impressive damage numbers with the help of the Backup Dancer buff, all from the role of sustain. Unless another sustain shows up with an explicit Break focus, Gallagher is going to be quite the appealing pick for maximising damage.This is an undeniably powerful kit, and on the Trailblazer of all things! With everyone gaining access to this wonderful break-focused kit, I can't help but think that the game might be shifting towards a Break meta and that the devs want everyone to have a way to make the most of it. Naturally, this means that if any future characters come out with a Break focus (or maybe existing characters like Xueyi), it's a solid bet that the Harmony Trailblazer will be an excellent teammate for them. They\u2019re still useable outside of Break teams, but you shouldn\u2019t expect them to outperform the usual cast when it comes to standard team setups.Don't be surprised to see this smooth criminal leading the charge for Break teams moving forward. Do not underestimate them, and let us all 'Hee-hee' into that White Night.\n"

            "formatted": "The Destruction Trailblazer is the first character players gain access to. They are a competent and versatile damage dealer in the early game that you will naturally unlock all the Eidolons for. They get a lot of free stat boosts during combat via Breaking enemies, and are able to choose from a hard-hitting single-target Ultimate and a Blast AoE Ultimate that is stronger against 3 targets.The very first version of the Trailblazer is a good damage dealer early on, especially as there are many Physical weak enemies for them to hit homeruns on. Later on in the game, this form of the Trailblazer will start to lose effectiveness as there is not much in their kit to allow them to truly excel. By no means does this make the Destruction Trailblazer unusable; if you choose to invest in them a lot they will eventually start to become very strong, but the undeniable truth is that there are far better ways to use your limited resources than focusing on a character that was designed to become obsolete.Their Skill is a Blast AoE, dealing damage to the targeted enemy and the adjacent foes. This is the only Blast AoE in the game that does not inherently deal more damage to the targeted enemy, instead dealing the same damage to all three enemies hit. This Skill will still deal increased Toughness damage to the primary foe.\u00a0The multiplier on this Skill is not very impressive at all, especially as there are not many ways for the Destruction Trailblazer to boost their own damage without outside help; 125% ATK at max Trace level is quite underwhelming in single-target scenarios, but it does start to become quite powerful in multi-target situations.The Destruction Trailblazer\u2019s Ultimate is also one of a kind, as it\u2019s the only Ultimate in the game at present to give you a choice of attack, either a massive single-target swing, or a Blast AoE hit. Both versions are surprisingly strong in terms of their raw multipliers, with the single target swing dealing up to 450% ATK, and the Blast dealing 270% ATK to the main target and 162% to adjacent foes for a total multiplier of 594%. This is quite a hefty amount for only a 120 cost Ultimate.It is now plain to see that much of the Destruction Trailblazer\u2019s power is focused in their Ultimate, especially in single-target encounters. It is unfortunate then that the Trailblazer has no inherent ways of gaining more Energy for themselves, and the Ultimate itself is not strong enough to offset the lackluster damage outside of it.Their Talent helps somewhat as it offers a permanent ATK boost of 20% at max Trace level, stacking twice for up to 40%. This can only be obtained via the Trailblazer directly breaking enemies, or by killing them with their E6. A permanent ATK boost is always appreciated, especially as it is approaching the value of a main stat Relic piece, but ATK is already a very saturated stat; there are many ways to get more of it, and many support characters specialise in providing more ATK for characters. As a result, this Talent ends up losing a lot of value over time, especially as the player gains access to more support options.The conditions for activating this Talent are also rather strict. It is very easy to activate in the early game where there are many weak enemies whose Toughness gauges are miniscule, enough that a single targeted Skill will break them, or they can be killed outright. As the game progresses though, there are more enemies showing up that have larger Toughness gauges and substantially larger health pools, making it increasingly more difficult to activate this Talent\u2019s boosts.\u00a0Their Major Traces provide some extra benefits but nothing too spectacular until A6. A2 gives a free 15 Energy at the start of a fight, and A4 allows the Talent to also stack 10% DEF, for a total of 20% DEF. Neither of these are particularly significant, though the extra free DEF is definitely appreciated in terms of survivability. A6 however grants a 25% damage bonus to the single-target damage portions of their AoE abilities. Definitely a big increase to the overall performance of Destruction Trailblazer, but a shame it comes so late.In terms of Eidolons, as the main character, you will earn all of their Eidolons over time. Rather unfortunately, none of them are substantial increases in performance \u2014 the unfortunate fate of a starter unit such as this. The only really intriguing one is E4, which gives a 25% increase to CRIT Rate when attacking enemies currently afflicted with Weakness Break, as not only is this a large amount of CRIT to be getting for basically free, it also doesn\u2019t discriminate what the enemy is actually weak to, meaning any Broken enemy will provide this benefit even if they are not weak to Physical.The Destruction Trailblazer is definitely versatile in the early and even mid game sections, but suffers from trying to do too much at once. They want to have good damage in both single-target and AoE but are spread too thin and so can never excel in either; their Minor Traces are an even spread of ATK, HP, and DEF meaning they are never quite strong enough to accentuate the things they are good at; and their most pivotal upgrades in the form of A6 and E4 come too late for it to matter, since by that point most players will already have other characters they wish to level.There\u2019s just no opportunity for the Destruction Trailblazer to thrive. When faced with the inevitable question of \u2018Is Destruction Trailblazer worth my resources and materials?\u2019. Outside of levelling them up for the alternate versions of the Trailblazer the story will eventually unlock, the equally inevitable answer is in virtually all cases \u2018No\u2019.\u00a0The final nail in that coffin is that each flavour of Trailblazer are mutually exclusive with each other; if you\u2019re using one, you\u2019re not using the others, and as the paths also differ greatly so too do the relics and Light Cones, and Trace upgrade progress is not shared either, so unless you\u2019re absolutely dead set on using the Destruction Trailblazer, they are an investment black hole.All the other Physical characters are substantially more powerful and at least have niches in which they are able to truly excel. Sushang and Luka dominate the single-target spaces and are fairly accessible as 4-stars. Meanwhile, Clara and Argenti are absolute behemoths, with the former being quite accessible as a standard 5-star, potentially even being players first 5-star ever, basically solidifying that the Destruction form of the Trailblazer is promptly shelved. Argenti is a limited 5-star, but he\u2019s almost a perfect refinement of the Trailblazer\u2019s kit, having enough power to comfortably place him among the top damage dealers in the game.Of course, if you just like using the Destruction Trailblazer then you are more than welcome to. It is just a game after all, and the primary and arguably only intent is to have fun. There are already videos of people using this version of the Trailblazer to massacre the final stages of Memory of Chaos, and there\u2019s probably only going to be more over time, so you can rest assured that if you do choose to go down this path, you will be rewarded.Just remember dear reader: there is no circumventing the cost, and regret has a way of sticking around. Believe me, I would know\u2026 But it is ultimately your choice. \u2018Rules are meant to be broken\u2019 after all."

While he\u2019s no longer the only Imaginary unit in the game, his kit still provides him much value even now, being a part of many of the most fun and safe teams in the game.Welt\u2019s Skill is a Bounce ability, dealing up to 72% ATK to a target enemy and then 72% ATK 2 more times to a random enemy each hit. Each hit has a 75% base chance to apply Slow, reducing the enemy\u2019s SPD by 10% for 2 turns. Initially seeming like a rather weak Skill, its true power relies on the effects of his Talent.Welt\u2019s Talent will deal additional Imaginary DMG whenever he hits an enemy that is already Slowed, dealing up to an additional 60% ATK per hit. This functions as a multiplier increase, greatly increasing his overall damage output, and the reason he deals more damage than one would initially expect.Combining his Skill with his Talent makes his Skill go from dealing a meagre 216% ATK in total to dealing 396% ATK instead, an amount more similar to some characters\u2019 Ultimates. With this being on the Skill, it\u2019s easy to maintain this amount of damage over the course of a fight, as well as maintaining the Slow required to activate the Talent. With his Skill also being a Bounce ability, it also deals vastly increased Toughness damage, and the extra hits offset the lowered base chance to apply the Slow, since you just have more hits to try and apply it with.Welt\u2019s Ultimate deals 150% ATK to all enemies and has a 100% base chance to Imprison enemies hit for 1 turn. Imprisoned enemies have their action delayed by up to 40% and have their SPD reduced by 10%. Combined with the Slow from his Skill, Welt can absolutely send his enemies to the Shadow Realm. Forced Imprisonment is extremely powerful as a defensive tool, not only because it delays enemies\u2019 actions by a significant margin but also because it\u2019s a control effect.If you use Welt\u2019s Ultimate after an Elite or Boss has started acting and you land the Imprisonment, their turn will just instantly end, because Imprisonment is a control effect. It quite literally says that affected units are unable to take action.What this means is that Welt can just deny Elites and Bosses their Extra Actions they usually take, removing much of the danger they normally pose. Malefic Ape charging up an attack on someone? Denied. True Sting wanting to start charging his big AoE? Don\u2019t think so, buddy. Ebondeer about to teamwipe you with his AoE upswing? \u2018I\u2019m about to ruin this man\u2019s whole career.\u2019It\u2019s a very underrated aspect of Welt\u2019s kit, and it\u2019s this kind of role consolidation that makes him an exceptional generalist character. It also expands his possible roles further into being a more supportive secondary damage dealer for the likes of Dr. Ratio or even Imbibitor Lunae, especially since the Imprisonment from Welt\u2019s Ultimate will facilitate the full 4-piece set effect of the Wastelander of Banditry Relic Set, something that the other two damage dealers are not capable of doing themselves, ordinarily.This is accentuated further by Welt\u2019s Bonus Ability Traces. A2 in particular adds on functionality onto the Ultimate by giving it a 100% base chance to inflict a 12% DMG vulnerability to enemies hit for 2 turns. This vulnerability is applied before the actual damage from the Ultimate lands meaning you can immediately benefit from it. This also gives Welt an extra debuff to apply to enemies for the purpose of Dr. Ratio\u2019s follow-up chance, as well as for any other effects that rely on debuff count to function.A4 allows for more frequent Ultimates from Welt by refunding 10 Energy whenever he uses his Ultimate, and A6 gives Welt a 20% DMG bonus against enemies that are Weakness Broken. Since Welt has an easy-to-access delay buster in his kit, he can extend the Break duration of enemies by just not letting them have a turn, meaning he can really take advantage of this free extra DMG. This is especially true with Ruan Mei in the party, and this way Welt not only gets to deal highly competent damage but also gets to greatly reduce the overall incoming damage to the team.As a standard 5-star, it is not unlikely to get Eidolons for Welt over time. He definitely doesn\u2019t need them to be competitive, but they do offer some nice bonuses. E2 in particular can offer an additional source of consistent Energy and may result in shifting how long it takes to get his Ultimate, further expanding on both his offensive and supportive capabilities.Welt\u2019s got plenty of different team comps he can fit in due to his diverse nature. His damage is still good enough that you want to be putting him in a team where he can actively use SP for his Skill, and even then, you\u2019d want to be using his Skill anyway for its Slow debuff. You can even opt for an Energy Regeneration Rate Link Rope on him to get even more Ultimates, but do know that you are sacrificing a very significant amount of damage by doing so, and the most significant Energy gains are still from using his Skill. So long as you can solve any potential SP issues, Welt works well as a hypercarry, a secondary dps, a support, or some combination of all of those.He struggles a bit more in AoE content due to his Skill\u2019s Bounce, but his Ultimate can still hit everything on the field quite easily. He can do it all, and he\u2019s still got plenty of value to offer. The only limitation is the player\u2019s imagination."

Choose the one that grants the best crit ratio.Feet - SpeedBest in slot.Planar Sphere - ATK%Xueyi already has an incredible amount of DMG% for free from her bonus ability with superior scaling from Break Effect. For this reason, ATK% Sphere grants her more damage than a Quantum one.Link Rope - Break Effect%Best in slot.Additional notes for sub-statsBreak Effect is Xueyi's best damage scaling stat when including Quantum Entanglement in the equation. Stacking only Break Effect will not yield the best results though, so aim for a good CRIT and CRIT DMG ratio and as high Break Effect as possible. Pick up ATK% as a bonus and ensure you have enough Speed through your teammates or sub-stats to hit your desired Speed breakpoint.BREAK EFFECT: Xueyi's bonus ability grants her DMG% equal to her Break Effect% for free - this is one of the strongest bonus abilities in the game allowing her to be built as a Breaker while also doing immense personal damage. When considering Xueyi's potential Entanglement damage Break Effect becomes by far her best stat while still being competitive even without the ability to break an enemy. Getting a solid amount of Break Effect on top of a decent CRIT Ratio is your priority.CRIT Rate & CRIT DMG: CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG are strong for Xueyi despite her having incredible damage from her entanglements - aim for 1% CRIT RATE per 2% CRIT DMG.SPEED: Speed as with most standard direct damage carries is incredibly important on Xueyi. Hitting a strong Memory of Chaos breakpoint is also advised when aiming to achieve the fastest and most comfortable endgame clears. Stacking Speed past your desired breakpoint isn't advised though. Remember you can gain Speed via teammates buff such as Asta, Ruan Mei, and Hanya.ATK%: ATK% is comparatively more valuable on Xueyi than other characters as she gains a tremendous amount of DMG% from her Break Effect and sacrifices the usual ATK% rope in favor of a Break% rope. Aim to pick up ATK% as a bonus after focusing on Break effect and CRIT stats as it's still a great source of damage.DMG%: Standard DMG% is not a desirable stat on Xueyi as she gains DMG% equal to her Break Effect. In Star Rail, all sources of Break Effect % are equivalently larger than DMG% meaning it's always better to build Break and gain Dmg% for free than stacking DMG% directly unless it's a stat you're gaining through a teammate or for free on an otherwise already ideal Light Cone or Relic."

This set and the world it's farmed in has narrow use across other characters though making it stamina-inefficient to farm.Space Sealing StationStrong generic, high-end easy set to farm that performs well on Xueyi, can lose out to CRIT planar sets in full team compositions and high-end gear sets.Inert SalsottoBest CRIT planar set for Xueyi that makes hitting a strong crit ratio far easier and in full team compositions is recommended if Talia is not an option.Firmament Frontline: GlamothA reasonable baseline set with the 135 Speed bonus but a strong contender if 160-speed can be achieved which is mostly possible through the use of team buffs."

        "review": {
            "formatted": "Xueyi is a strong generalist damage dealer capable of dealing Toughness damage to enemies not weak to Quantum. She interacts with enemy Toughness Gauges to gain stacks towards a powerful follow-up attack, greatly increasing her effectiveness against Quantum-weak foes. Xueyi scales with Break Effect, gaining bonus DMG% per point of Break Effect, resulting in a large permanent boost to her damage output, but due to her reliance on doing Toughness damage, the teams and scenarios you can use her are pretty restrictive.The Ten-Lords Judge inhabiting a puppet body and sister to Hanya, Xueyi, is a formidable ally. Alongside Ruan Mei, she has a heavy focus on Break and Break Effect, making great use of an otherwise neglected and suboptimal stat. She has a wordy but relatively simple and effective kit.Xueyi\u2019s Skill is a Blast AoE, dealing up to 140% ATK to the primary target and 70% to adjacent foes. Xueyi\u2019s Ultimate deals damage to a single enemy, up to 250% ATK. This attack deals 120 Toughness damage, notably higher than almost all other single-target Ultimates in the game and having parity with Imbibitor Lunae\u2019s Fulgurant Leap. Even more impressive is that this Toughness damage ignores the Weakness Type of the enemy, meaning this attack does not care if its target doesn\u2019t have a Quantum weakness.If this Toughness damage Breaks the enemy, the attack will also inflict Quantum Break on them, causing Entanglement. The more Toughness reduced, the higher the DMG dealt will be, up to an increase of a very substantial 60%, meaning it is more powerful when used on an enemy that still has a good amount of Toughness remaining.The wordy part but also one of the most important parts of Xueyi\u2019s kit is her Talent. When reducing Toughness with attacks, Xueyi gets stacks of Karma, up to 8. At 8 stacks, she will unleash a 3-hit follow-up attack, each one dealing up to 90% ATK to a single enemy. When Xueyi reduces Toughness, she gains Karma stacks based on how much she reduced it by \u2014 1 stack for every 30 Toughness reduced. When allies reduce Toughness, Xueyi gets 1 Karma stack.The follow-up deals 270% ATK in total and ends up being a fairly big part of Xueyi\u2019s personal damage. The follow-up itself will not add stacks of Karma, but with the increased acquisition that Xueyi herself gets as well assistance from allies, she will still be able to get to this follow-up attack fairly frequently, especially when you consider that her Ultimate deals Type-ignoring Toughness damage, and the 120 Toughness damage it deals will immediately add 4 stacks. The follow-up attack also deals 15 Toughness damage per hit and restores 6 Energy in total, so it also helps with Energy economy.Looking at just the raw numbers makes it seem like Xueyi doesn\u2019t deal very much damage, and, aside from the Ultimate, doesn\u2019t stand out at all. This is where her Bonus Ability Traces swoop in to tell the rest of the story. The least impressive of these is her A4 will let her Ultimate deal 10% more DMG against enemies whose Toughness is higher than 50% of their Max.The big one is Xueyi\u2019s A2. It will increase the DMG she deals by an amount equal to 100% of her Break Effect stat, up to a maximum bonus of 240%. Yes this is as silly as it sounds. This means that you take whatever your Break Effect% is at \u2014 and now that\u2019s the DMG% bonus you have, just passively. Racking up enough Break Effect for this to reach some amazing heights is not hugely difficult especially since her Minor Traces give her 37.3% Break Effect for absolutely free, meaning a Break Effect Link Rope will put Xueyi\u2019s Break Effect to just over 100%, which of course thanks to her A2 means she\u2019s also getting a permanent 100% DMG bonus to everything.Any extra Break Effect is just icing on the cake, and this one Bonus Ability Trace makes Xueyi deal very substantial and, more importantly, very consistent damage. With her ability to Break whomever she wants as well, she can very easily make use of the extremely powerful burst of damage that the Entanglement status provides with this amount of Break Effect.Because this provides so much DMG% for Xueyi, she actually doesn\u2019t really want a Quantum DMG Planar Sphere, since they\u2019re the same type of DMG%, and so it\u2019s not providing as much as it would for others. This means you finally have a use for your definitely not copium ATK% Spheres, and it\u2019s actually her best stat for that slot. You shouldn\u2019t get too entranced by this though. Investing into CRIT Rate and DMG is also important and you can't rely on the Break Effect alone.A6 essentially keeps a tally of how many stacks of Karma you overcap by, making it so that if you annihilate a Toughness bar at 7 out of 8 stacks, you aren\u2019t just throwing away all those Karma stacks.This combination makes Xueyi contend with some of the really heavy hitters, and with this amount of natural DMG% in her kit, she plays very well with pretty much all supports, especially the ones that can increase her Action rate to get more Energy for Ultimates and more of those Karma stacks for her follow-up. Bronya and Tinyun are natural pairings, though Asta and Hanya can also be good thanks to their SPD buffs and due to them always attacking on their turns for more potential Karma stacks for Xueyi. Silver Wolf, Pela, and Ruan Mei are also great partners for Xueyi as they can increase the Entanglement damage done by her.Xueyi is already strong at base at E0, but she has some very impactful Eidolons that can noticeably improve her performance. E1 increasing the DMG of the follow-up by 40% is always appreciated since it\u2019s free, and E2 will let Xueyi\u2019s follow-up attacks deal Toughness damage regardless of Type and even give her a slight heal of 5% Max HP. As with the Ultimate, Breaking enemies with the follow-up will similarly inflict Quantum Break. E4 increases Break Effect by 40% for 2 turns after using her Ultimate, which is just more DMG% on top of everything else, and E6 will reduce the max stacks of Karma down to 6, resulting in yet more follow-up attacks.Surprisingly there\u2019s not much left to say. Xueyi is a very potent and consistent character, and her interactions with Break and Break Effect make her not only quite unique but likely to only improve over time. She\u2019s good as a hypercarry, but with how her kit works she\u2019s also very good as a secondary damage dealer in dual-carry comps. Maximizing the Toughness damage that she deals is key to skyrocketing her performance, meaning using your Ultimate on enemies without Quantum Weakness so that you have more to hit with her Skill. Depending on how things pan out, she may even be the next Qingque, hah\u2026 Though only time will tell if that\u2019s an overcooked dream.A definite issue to keep in mind is that because of the uniqueness of Xueyi\u2019s kit, her investment ceiling is so massive that it\u2019s virtually unattainable; you\u2019re only ever going to be \u2018done\u2019 with this character when every single one of your relics are 10/10 perfection, and the progression for this is also exceedingly steep. It\u2019s been mentioned for other characters that they require a lot of investment, but they do not hold a candle to the grossly incandescent Xueyi. As a result, Xueyi\u2019s potential is high, but it also means the journey to get there may be very time-consuming, as even the tiniest bump in stats can translate to a significant increase in combat.The other big thing is that Xueyi annihilates Quantum-weak foes. This makes the performance difference when fighting non QUA-weak enemies rather stark when comparing to other characters \u2014 it\u2019s not that she becomes unusable, it\u2019s just that because of how good Xueyi is against the right enemies she feels wasted being put against anything else.Mismatching Elemental Weaknesses is a negative thing that is shared by pretty much every character in the game (unless your name is either Seele or Kafka), and while Xueyi has the tools to work around a mismatched Weakness, you absolutely should not expect her to bring the same level of decimation to fights that feature literally zero Quantum weaknesses. I think we all know by now whose fault that would be. Putting Xueyi with teammates who are capable of dealing Toughness damage to enemies will greatly impact her performance, and if nobody on your team is capable of dealing Toughness damage, then I think you\u2019ve fundamentally misunderstood one of the core aspects of the game.Xueyi is easily one of the best 4-star damage dealers, and has a lot of staying power thanks to her unique kit. The road to powering her up is long\u2026 Long enough to make one mara-struck, but it is most assuredly worth it. Do not underestimate this character."

            "formatted": "Yanqing is a standard 5-star character and a single-target specialist. He has very competent damage against single foes and has impressive CRIT buffs through his Talent and Ultimate. His Talent also allows him to occasionally launch a follow-up attack after attacking with a chance of Freezing the foe. He relies on not taking any damage at all to maintain these strong buffs, losing them immediately if this condition is not met, and requiring an additional turn to regain the benefits.This poor boy. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s actually one of the strongest people on the Luofu, but he just keeps picking fights with, like, the precious few people stronger than him. Sadly it doesn\u2019t get too much better for him in actual gameplay. I will lead with the statement that Yanqing can do very considerable damage \u2014 IF everything goes his way, but I will show you why that may be far more difficult to achieve than you\u2019d expect.Yanqing\u2019s Talent gives him a buff called Soulsteel Sync and is activated by his Skill. While Soulsteel Sync is active, Yanqing is less likely to be targeted by enemies and gains up to an extra 20% CRIT Rate and 30% CRIT DMG. With Soulsteel Sync active, any attack that Yanqing makes has a 60% fixed chance of launching a follow-up attack on the attacked foe, dealing up to 50% ATK and having a 65% base chance to Freeze the target.As far as stat boosting Talents go, this is certainly one of the more impressive ones, and can result in a great deal of damage coming out, especially if the follow-up occurs even semi-frequently, and \u2014 huh? What\u2019s this last line here\u2026 \u2018When Yanqing receives DMG, the Soulsteel Sync effect will disappear.\u2019 Oh.Yeah\u2026 This sounds like it\u2019s not something that should be too difficult to maintain but this is quite literally any amount of damage. Even a literal single digit point of damage \u2014 even literally 1 damage, and all of the benefits of this Talent vanish into thin air. Worse still is that when Yanqing uses his Skill to activate this Talent, he\u2019ll only start benefiting from its effects after his turn ends, meaning you have an entire turn of downtime if you take any damage at all.This was far less of an issue in the early moments of the game when enemies were simple and predictable. Nowadays, enemies can quite frequently bust out AoE attacks without much warning, both Blast and full AoE. AoE abilities don\u2019t really care about Yanqing\u2019s reduced likelihood of being targeted because, quite simply, who cares when you can just hit everyone, right? This makes it extremely challenging to maintain this Talent\u2019s effects, making whatever powerful bonuses it does provide completely moot.Yanqing\u2019s Skill deals up to 220% ATK to a single enemy and will activate Soulsteel Sync for 1 turn. Herein lies the next issue; Soulsteel Sync only has a 1 turn duration, so if Yanqing is ever afflicted by crowd control effects like Concussion or Freeze, and his turn is skipped, this will also result in needing to wait for the next turn over to make use of Soulsteel Sync once more.Yanqing\u2019s Ultimate first buffs his CRIT Rate by 60%, with up to an additional 50% CRIT DMG if Soulsteel Sync is active. These buffs last for 1 turn and stack additively with his Talent\u2019s CRIT buffs. He then deals up to 350% ATK to a single enemy. Without his Talent\u2019s effects active, Yanqing loses a considerable amount of damage from this Ultimate and on the following turn. It also has a very high Energy cost of 140.Everything revolves around this Talent for him, and it\u2019s got the harshest penalties for even the slightest thing going awry. Took a single point of damage? No more Talent. Missed your turn because of unavoidable crowd control? Must be a skill issue. Didn\u2019t have the SP to use his Skill without interruption? Okay, that might actually be a skill issue\u2026Perhaps now you see why it\u2019s difficult to maintain Yanqing\u2019s damage profile. His ability multipliers are also lower than you\u2019d expect for a unit entirely limited to single-target damage and that\u2019s mostly to account for the large amounts of free CRIT stats he gets from his Talent and Ultimate. The issue of course is that if Soulsteel Sync ever drops for whichever of the many reasons it might, Yanqing\u2019s damage vanishes in a flash, and it takes a lot to get back to it.A team for Yanqing must contain a Shielder. Only damage done to Yanqing\u2019s actual HP bar will disable Soulsteel Sync, so Shields are outright necessary for him to function in the end game where there is frequent incoming AoE damage. This currently limits you to pretty much just Gepard, as he is the only Shielder who is viable as a solo sustain. This is already a very tall ask because even if Gepard is also a standard 5-star character like Yanqing, it\u2019s still a whole other 5-star that you may not end up getting for quite a while.If you want to be safe as well, having a way to cleanse Yanqing is also useful because you don\u2019t want to have your turn forcibly skipped, and the only way you can do that without having to run a double sustain comp is to use Bronya for her Skill\u2019s cleanse before the Action Advance. This is yet another standard 5-star character that you may not have access to, and another character who is better spent on other less temperamental DPS characters.\u00a0Finally because of his extremely high cost Ultimate, the last unit will almost certainly be Tingyun, and this takes her away from other Ultimate reliant units who can do far more damage against far more enemies with the Energy Tingyun grants them.This is the dilemma. Even if your Yanqing is well built and well invested, he has a crippling reliance on his other teammates to actually be able to use the power he has, because again, if everything goes his way he actually deals very considerable damage. Budget versions of the above characters do exist but it\u2019s just sunk-cost at that point; March can provide consistent Shields but they raise Yanqing\u2019s aggro meaning they will take more damage and thus need to be reapplied more often, consuming yet more SP in the process; Asta can increase the SPD of Yanqing thereby mitigating any losses you may sustain from losing Soulsteel Sync; and Yukong can very impressively buff Yanqing for a single massive burst with his Ultimate, stacking even greater CRIT stats.But actually, what about those CRIT stats? 20% CRIT Rate and 30% CRIT DMG from his Talent is pretty good, this is true, but then an additional 60% CRIT Rate from his Ultimate means that with no further investment, Yanqing naturally sits at 85% during his Ultimate. See, this is an issue because it\u2019s a colossal overcap if you\u2019re trying to build Yanqing with Planar sets like Rutilant Arena in mind.Rutilant Arena needs 70% CRIT Rate in combat to grant a 20% DMG bonus to a character\u2019s Skill and Basic ATK, but with this much CRIT Rate, Yanqing\u2019s Ultimate will overcap his CRIT Rate by 58%... To literally zero benefit. Well, okay, so you just don\u2019t go for that much CRIT so you don\u2019t overcap, right? Wrong. Without the base CRIT Rate, you won\u2019t activate the set bonus of the Planar, and your consistency in combat will also plummet because the only time you\u2019ll have a consistent nuke is during the effects of his Ultimate \u2014 his 140 Energy cost Ultimate.Yeah, it\u2019s ironic how the best thing about Yanqing at lower levels is also his biggest headache at the end game. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to not waste stats with this guy. My advice is just accept that you\u2019re going to have crazy overcapping of CRIT Rate and just go for the maximum consistency. This is especially true due to his Bonus Traces.Yanqing\u2019s A2 will deal an additional 30% ATK to Ice-weak foes. His A4 will increase his Effect RES by 20% during Soulsteel Sync, and his A6 grants him a 10% SPD increase for 2 turns upon scoring a CRIT. It\u2019s very easy to maintain this SPD bonus, and it\u2019s also quite appreciated due to Yanqing\u2019s high base SPD of 109. Against specifically Ice-weak foes, Yanqing will definitely destroy them if you can facilitate the rest of his kit.As a standard 5-star character, it is not unlikely to get Eidolons for Yanqing over time. It is with a heavy heart that I must say I don\u2019t think they really improve much for Yanqing as his issues are not with his damage. Amusingly I think E6 might be the one that makes things a little easier, and even then it\u2019s a bit of a coin toss. The worst part about him is that he can show up to ruin your pity, and depending on who you ask, that makes him far and away the worst character in this game.\u00a0In the original version of this review I said \u2018I encourage you to experiment to see where the pitfalls start and end, and adjust your setups accordingly\u2019, and I can safely say we are all now very well aware of where the pitfalls start. What I can\u2019t see is where they end.\u00a0"

            "formatted": "Yukong is a support with extraordinarily powerful buffs and breaking utility, but is definitely one of the most challenging units to use thus far. She requires more effort to use than the other Harmony characters, substantially so in fact, but she can assuredly be worth the effort\u2014if you\u2019re willing to work for it.I\u2019ll start with Yukong\u2019s Talent, because it\u2019s something of an outlier as far as expected support Talents. Every other turn, Yukong\u2019s Basic attack gets Enhanced, dealing up to an additional 80% of her ATK at max Trace level, as well as increasing the Toughness damage by 100%! A Basic attack dealing damage potentially equal to 180% of a character\u2019s ATK while still restoring a Skill Point is already exceptional, but the fact it deals twice as much Toughness damage as well is just insane. Yukong can end up contributing a huge amount of Toughness damage thanks to this one Talent, and because it actually has a decent multiplier, she can contribute pretty decent team damage as well.Her primary method of buffing is through her Skill. Using it gives Yukong 2 stacks of Roaring Bowstrings, increasing the ATK of all allies by up to 80% at max Trace level, while stacks persist. She loses 1 stack on every ally turn after hers. This buff can be compounded further thanks to her Ultimate.Yukong\u2019s Ultimate targets a single enemy, and deals a very respectable amount of damage, up to 380% of her ATK at max Trace level. At the same time, if Roaring Bowstrings is still active, it will add up to 28% Crit Rate and 65% Crit DMG to the effects of Roaring Bowstrings at max Trace level. Both of these effects combined means Yukong can provide 80% ATK, 28% Crit Rate and 65% Crit DMG all by herself. This also has a remarkably high damage multiplier for a support, and since these buffs are all active before the Ultimate\u2019s damage comes out, said Ultimate benefits fully from all of these fantastic effects.However, you may have already noticed a glaring issue in that the very powerful Roaring Bowstrings effects will dissipate before your third ally turn, meaning one of your characters will never be affected by it. Ever. But it\u2019s okay, you can do some pre-planning to make sure that Yukong is always acting immediately before your main damage dealer, and that way they\u2019ll always be able to make use of her buffs, right? Ah but what if there are fluctuating SPD values due to various buffs and debuffs that many units and enemies have?Well, this is where problems arise. You can definitely plan a team in advance and expect that Yukong\u2019s buffs will always affect the correct allies, but realistically there are inevitably going to be extenuating circumstances that interfere with that plan. Allies may fall in and out of ideal turn order due to many different things, and it falls to the player to make the most out of whatever hand you\u2019re dealt.If you\u2019re using characters that naturally alter their SPD or have mechanics like turn advance, such as Sushang or a Wind damage dealer using the Eagle of Twilight Line relic set, this is not that big of a concern actually, because even if a desync occurs, they will naturally realign themselves over time anyway. It\u2019s a little more problematic if a desync occurs with characters that have set SPD values, but again, it\u2019s not insurmountable.\u00a0The way you can work around this is by paying attention to the specific wording of Yukong\u2019s Skill; every ally turn will consume a stack, meaning any and all Extra Actions can be freely used as long as 1 stack of Roaring Bowstrings persists. This includes ally Ultimates, so especially if the majority of a character\u2019s power is concentrated into their Ultimate, they can still benefit fully from Yukong\u2019s buffs even if a turn desync occurs.Keeping track of all of these aspects of Yukong\u2019s kit is incredibly demanding, what with managing her powerful buffs efficiently and actually having meaningful uses of her Ultimate, while still trying to find good uses of her equally powerful Talent. It is not an understatement to call her the most difficult-to-play unit to date. Even Qingque is simple by comparison, but as with our favorite mahjong gremlin, the effort is well worth the output.Yukong\u2019s Bonus Traces are very impactful and have a big effect on her performance. Her A2 allows her to resist 1 debuff once every 2 turns. This means any debuff at all, be it a DoT or a crowd-controlling debuff like Imprisonment, so this can potentially prevent the aforementioned turn desync from occurring from Yukong\u2019s side at least.Her A4 increases all Imaginary DMG dealt by all allies by 12% as long as she\u2019s alive, meaning she\u2019s going to be a good pairing with Imaginary damage dealers like Welt, and this even goes a long way to improving her own personal damage contribution.\u00a0The most impactful Bonus Trace is her A6. When Roaring Bowstrings is active, Yukong regenerates 2 additional Energy every time an ally takes action. Note it says action and not turn, meaning Extra Actions and Ultimates will also contribute to this Energy regeneration, even Yukong\u2019s own Ultimate usage, and this is actually a very significant amount of Energy coming back to Yukong over the course of a fight.Yukong\u2019s Eidolons are not necessary for her to perform exceptionally at E0, but they are welcome all the same. E2, E4, and especially E6 provide notable quality-of-life improvements, but Yukong\u2019s skill floor unfortunately remains quite high regardless.If you\u2019re willing to put in the effort for this silver fox, she\u2019ll perform amazingly both now and well into the future too. She has everything you may want from a support and then some, but it\u2019s locked behind layers of nuance and understanding. Can she be a formidable buffer akin to Tingyun and Bronya? Absolutely, but whether or not she\u2019ll reach those heights\u2026 That depends on the skill of the runner."

Therefore, speed boots are not recommended for her build. Planar Sphere - PHYS% > ATK% Best in Slot.Link Rope - ATK% >= Energy Regen % Attack% is generally the safer and more effective option for Yunli, providing consistent damage increases. However, in some niche scenarios, Energy Regen% can surpass Attack% due to its ability to grant a more favorable Ultimate breakpoint. This strategy relies on compensating for the lost Attack% through team buffs or other sources. Additional notes for sub-statsCrit Rate & Crit Damage: Yunli's damage output primarily comes from her powerful Ultimate and infused Follow-Up Attacks, which benefit from a significant bonus of 100% Crit Damage. This unique aspect can distort the perception of her Crit Ratio when viewed solely on the character page. To optimize her performance, it\u2019s essential to prioritize a high Crit Rate, even if it appears that her Crit Damage is somewhat low outside of combat. An acceptable Crit Ratio for Yunli is approximately 100% (Crit Rate) to 100% (Crit Damage). This ratio is crucial because, during actual combat scenarios, it effectively translates to something closer to 100% (Crit Rate) to 200% (Crit Damage) when her Ultimate and Follow-Up Attacks are utilized. Speed: Yunli's damage and Energy generation primarily rely on her Follow-Up Attacks and Ultimate-enhanced Follow-Up Attacks. These Follow-Up Attacks are triggered by enemy hits, making her largely dependent on the enemy's speed rather than her own. As a result, Speed is a less impactful stat for her overall effectiveness. Instead of focusing on Speed, it's more efficient to prioritize damaging stats. Yunli will achieve the same number of Follow-Ups regardless of her Speed, allowing her to maximize her damage potential without the need for additional Speed. "

            "formatted": "Yunli is a powerful counter-attacker akin to Clara. She will immediately retaliate when attacked by an enemy, dealing follow-up DMG in a Blast AoE. She will also gain vastly increased Energy gains when being attacked, and may store up to twice the Energy cost of her Ultimate, letting her more tactically use her Ultimate and prevent overcapping. Her enhanced state from her Ultimate will also prevent her from getting hit by Crowd Control and will reduce the DMG she takes. She is trickier to play than may initially appear, but the effort is worth it.Fellow sword enjoyer Yunli is a pretty great all-rounder character. She's a follow-up counter-attacker with good self-sustain and Energy economy, and she's got quite a strong kit. She is eerily similar to Clara in a great many ways, but there are some key differences that distinguish the two.Yunli's Talent is the centrepiece of her kit, and the first part of the puzzle. Whenever she is attacked by an enemy, she will immediately Counter them, dealing up to 120% ATK to the main target, and 60% ATK to adjacent foes. She will also restore 15 Energy whenever she is attacked, and this is in addition to the 10 Energy she gains from actually landing the Counter. If there is somehow no target to Counter when this activates, she will launch the Counter on a random enemy instead.On its own, it's not terribly impressive damage, but it is consistently activated and is a decent source of damage for Yunli. The incoming Energy gains are far more important and are extremely significant, feeding into her game plan perfectly, getting back 25 Energy each time she gets hit and Counters, almost an entire Skill's worth of Energy for doing nothing. The Toughness damage of the Counter is unimpressive, however; even though it is a Blast AoE, the primary target still only takes the minimal amount of Toughness damage.Her Skill is a copy of her Talent's Counter. Yunli will launch an attack against an enemy target, dealing the same Blast AoE and damage as from her Counter, 120% ATK against the main foe, and 60% ATK against adjacent ones. Curiously, this Blast AoE does deal the expected increased Toughness damage against the main foe compared to the Counter version, and will additionally restore HP for Yunli, up to 30% ATK plus 200 upon use.This is a pretty good means of self-sustain for Yunli should you need it for that, but the rather lacking damage means it's not always going to be used; when most of Yunli's damage comes from her Ultimate Talent's Counter, expending a Skill Point for basically the same effect on your turn may not always be the best option, especially since a Basic ATK is not that far behind in damage and will return a Skill Point instead. You can use this in a pinch to heal Yunli or to regain some extra Energy, but it's not advised to use this exclusively to speed up Breaking an enemy in most cases, as Broken foes cannot attack you, and that's kind of the whole point of the character.Yunli's Ultimate is the second part of the puzzle for her big damage. She consumes 120 Energy to gain the Parry stance, Taunting all enemies and increasing the CRIT DMG of Yunli's next Counter by up to 100%. This Parry state only lasts until the end of the next unit's turn, meaning it goes away after the next unit has finished acting, be it an ally or an enemy. This is important to keep in mind because there are two possible actions Yunli can take from the Parry state; Intuit: Cull is used if Yunli gets attacked during her Parry state, dealing up to 220% ATK to the attacker and 110% ATK to adjacent targets, and then dealing 6 additional instances of single-target damage, Bouncing between random enemies, up to 72% ATK per hit. If Yunli is NOT attacked during the short window of Parry, she will instead use Intuit: Slash on a random enemy, dealing the same upfront damage as Cull, but without the additional instances of damage.What this means is that you are extremely rewarded for good timing on Yunli's Ultimate, and are heavily punished for bad timing. If you use her Ultimate right before an enemy's turn, they are Taunted and have no choice but to attack Yunli, triggering Yunli's Cull and dealing stupidly high damage to all enemies on the field \u2014 the good ending. If, however, you use Yunli's Ultimate and it's an ally acting next, at the end of that ally's turn, Yunli will launch Slash and you'll do very little damage, losing out on most of the benefits of the enhanced Counter.This is why Yunli's Max Energy is at 240. Since a single Ultimate usage costs 120 Energy, you can essentially store up to 2 uses of Yunli's Ultimate, thus greatly mitigating the potential for losing out on Energy via overcapping. Because of her Talent's Energy influx, Yunli will constantly have the Energy for Ultimate uses, and you are able to gauge for yourself when you think it'll be best to use a charge. Do note that she cannot use her Ultimate again while the Parry state is active, and all damage done via this state is considered as Ultimate DMG.This is why Yunli can be considered to be quite difficult to make full use of, as having the Parry state dissipate before getting attacked will greatly reduce the damage Yunli will be doing, and with the regular damage from her Talent being as low as it is, there's actually quite a big reliance on her Ultimate to be dealing competitive damage. If you misjudge a situation and use the Ultimate at a bad time, you're going to be disappointed at the damage coming out, but the only one to blame will be you.Yunli's Bonus Ability Traces do much to improve her game plan. A2 in particular helps to alleviate the issues of mistimed Ultimates. Every time you use an Intuit: Slash (the version without the extra DMG instances), the next time you would have used an Intuit: Slash, it will instead be replaced with an Intuit: Cull (the good one). This means that even if enemies are not able to attack you or inflict damage through means beyond direct attacks, Yunli will still be able to get her maximum strength Counters albeit at a reduced rate.Even if you're completely not paying attention (or maybe getting trolled by the Auto mode), Yunli can still pop off. Interestingly enough, this does open the door to potentially massive burst windows by prepping an upgraded Slash in advance; you use an Ultimate in advance, letting the Parry state fall off, and then later you use an Ultimate to get hit by an enemy, followed by another Ultimate and launch a second Cull against enemies. This is a niche interaction, and while it can potentially be used to take full advantage of very limited buff durations, it is a very advanced concept and most players should stick to just timing her Ultimate well instead.A4 will further buff the Parry state, granting Yunli a 20% DMG Reduction as well as full immunity to all Crowd Control effects. There is quite literally no way that Yunli can be made to not land her Parry follow-ups, so all of you annoying Crowd Control heavy enemies, eat your hearts out and cry about it. A6 will grant a 1 turn 30% ATK boost whenever Yunli uses a Counter, giving a small but appreciated boost to damage for doing what you were doing anyway.In terms of Eidolons, as usual none of them are necessary for Yunli to excel, but a few of them are quite nice to have. E1 will increase the DMG% of Intuit: Slash and Intuit: Cull by 20%, and will additionally increase the extra hits of Cull by 3. E2 will make all damage dealt via Counters ignore 20% of targets' DEF. These two together tremendously increase damage at quite literally no extra cost and no change to gameplay. E4 will let Slash and Cull increase Yunli's Effect RES by 50% for 1 turn, mostly useful for non Crowd Control debuffs or whenever Parry is not available. Finally, E6 will make it so that Yunli can Parry enemy thoughts; if they act in any way even if they don't hit Yunli, Yunli will immediately launch an Intuit: Cull and remove the Parry state. Furthermore, dealing damage through Slash or Cull will increase CRIT Rate by 15% and Physical RES PEN by 20% for these actions.It's fairly easy to see how Yunli and Clara may be similar, but there are definitely key differences that set them apart and indeed make them excel in different situations. Both of them are reliant on their Ultimates to deal their big damage, but Clara does not have the failure condition like Yunli does; haphazard usage of Yunli's Ultimate can lead to big damage losses, even when factoring in her A2 bonus, but Clara does not have this limitation. Clara's base Counter damage is also higher against attackers, 160% ATK versus Yunli's 120% ATK.Clara's Enhanced Counter also deals a total of 640% ATK as a Blast AoE, whereas Yunli's Cull Counter deals a whopping 872% ATK spread across all enemies, but keep in mind that Clara gets 2 Enhanced Counters per Ultimate where Yunli only gets one. Clara's Skill also does comparatively more than Yunli's Skill, being able to hit all enemies on the field at all times and potentially doubling its damage against enemies with Svarog's Mark of Counter on them.As such, it's probably most accurate to say that while Yunli's damage ceiling is undeniably higher in most cases, Clara is just far less hassle to play. Both are great in all three endgame game modes, and their teams are also similar and similarly flexible. Yunli is, for the most part, a superior version of Clara, but please bear in mind that this does not in any way devalue what Clara does \u2014 after all, what\u2019s better than having one ballin\u2019 counter-attacker? Two. The answer is two counter-attackers.They both like similar teammates too, with units like Tingyun and Huohuo providing greater Ultimate uptime and damage boosts \u2014 Huohuo in particular restores a whopping 48 Energy with her Ultimate since Yunli's Max Energy is 240, even though she only needs 120 Energy for a use of her Ultimate. Robin also is exceptionally potent as all of her bonuses benefit Yunli, and the teamwide Action Advance is also notable as, like Clara, Yunli does not want to ever build SPD.Should you choose to play Yunli in a dual carry comp, Robin also excels at buffing both Yunli and whatever your other DPS character is. March 8th in particular can also be quite an impressive pairing, the student and the master on one team with their emotional support idol backing them up, though do keep in mind that March\u2019s automatic Action Advance when she gets her Enhanced Basic can result in scuffed Ultimate Parry timing for Yunli if you\u2019re not careful.These similarities do also mean that both characters face similar issues. Because both characters want to be hit to deal damage, any time they're not getting hit, they're doing next to no damage. Yunli can technically circumvent this, but amusingly enough she can\u2019t do it quite as well as Clara can due to Clara\u2019s teamwide Counter state during her Ultimate. It's still the same issue, though, and it's still quite prevalent for Yunli especially. This is particularly noticeable when looking at Yunli without her Signature Light Cone, because for whatever reason this Light Cone seems to have an absurdly high Aggro modifier. For the sake of consistency alone, getting Yunli's Light Cone for either character is worth considering.As such, Lynx is an incredibly important character to pair with Yunli most of the time to increase the consistency of Counters. As Yunli does not expressly need to be using her Skill to deal damage, you are more likely to have SP for Lynx to keep up her Skill buff on Yunli, increasing her HP and her aggro further. If you are not getting Yunli\u2019s Signature Light Cone, it is strongly recommended, and even borderline mandatory, that you use Lynx with Yunli for increased Counter consistency; this is much more accentuated than with Clara, as Clara's Enhanced Counters are launched even if she is not the one being attacked.Yunli is very capable and can wipe the floor with enemies quite easily. Remember to account for her increased CRIT DMG from her Ultimate when building for her, and try to keep track of enemy turns to make best use of her Parry mechanic. If you already own Clara, you may not feel the need to go for Yunli, but again, both of them are incredibly good characters and, if Clara is anything to go by, are going to continue to be good long into the future."

This effect is powerful within her kit, as increasing Yunli's chance to be hit enhances the number of Counters and Energy she can access in all scenarios, leading to far higher damage potential. Without this Light Cone, Yunli must rely on other sources, such as Lynx's skill, to achieve similar effects and reach her maximum potential. Essentially, this taunting effect allows you to bring any sustaining character instead of Lynx, which can result in tremendous survivability and damage boosts for the team. Additionally, the Light Cone provides an effective 72% damage increase to Yunli's Ultimate and Follow-Up attacks, along with a 36% increase to her Crit Damage. This combination of effects solidifies this Cone as a top-tier choice for enhancing Yunli's overall performance in combat."

Fortunately, this downside isn't a significant issue for Yunli, as she doesn't heavily rely on her Skill usage. Additionally, the Energy Recharge% can effectively compensate for the Energy lost by prioritizing Basics over Skills. However, it does require two full turns of ramp-up time to become fully active, and utilizing Basic Attacks in AoE fights may feel a bit more punishing compared to Single-Target encounters."

To achieve its full potential, the Attack% buff requires a brief ramp-up time, which may vary depending on the battle scenario. Additionally, a portion of its damage value is contingent on the Break-related Damage% buff, which might not be consistently active in every fight. As a result, it's helpful to evaluate how this Light Cone performs under two scenarios: one where the Damage% Break buff is always active and another where it is never activated. "

Yunli's standard Talent-based Counters only deal one hit per target (with a maximum of three stacks against three enemies), while her Ultimate can hit over eight times on a single enemy and even more on multiple targets. This variability means that Yunli may sometimes achieve maximum stacks but fall short at other times. Fortunately, her strongest hits\u2014specifically the slashes from her Ultimate\u2014will be close to fully buffed, making this set still competitive even if it cannot unlock its full potential. "
